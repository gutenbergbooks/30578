<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DEATH VALLEY TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>The heat hung like smoke above Panamint Sink, it surged up against the hills
like the waves of a great sea that boiled and seethed in the sun; and the
mountains that walled it in gleamed and glistened like polished jet where the
light was struck back from their sides. They rose up in solid ramparts,
unbelievably steep and combed clean by the sluicings of cloudbursts; and where
the black canyons had belched forth their floods a broad wash spread out,
writhing and twisting like a snake-track, until at last it was lost in the Sink.
For the Sink was the swallower-up of all that came from the hills and whatever
it sucked in it buried beneath its sands or poisoned on its alkali flats. Yet
the Death Valley trail led across its level floor&#8211;thirty miles from Wild
Rose Springs to Blackwater and its saloons&#8211;and while the heat danced and
quivered there was a dust in the north pass and a pack-train swung round the
point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>It came on
furiously, four burros with flat packs and an old man who ran cursing behind;
and as he passed down into the Sink there was another dust in the north and a
lone man followed as furiously after him. He was young and tall, a mountain of
rude strength, and as he strode off down the trail he brandished a piece of
quartz and swung his hat in the air. But the pack-train kept on, a column of
swirling dust, a blotch of burro-gray in the heat; and as he emptied his canteen
he hurled it to the ground and took after his partner on the run. He could see
the twinkling feet, the heave of the white packs, the vindictive form dodging
behind; and then his knees weakened, his throbbing brain seemed to burst and he
fell down cursing in the trail. But the pack-train went on like a tireless
automaton that no human power could stay and when he raised his head it was a
streamer of dust, a speck on the far horizon.</p>

<p>He rose up slowly and looked around&#8211;at the empty trail, the waterless
flats, the barren hills all about&#8211;and then he raised his fist, which still
clutched the chunk of quartz, and shook it at the pillar of dust. His throat was
dry and no words came, to carry the burden of his hate, but as he stumbled along
his eyes were on the dust-cloud and he choked out gusty oaths. A demoniac
strength took possession of his limbs and once more he broke into a run, the
muttered oaths grew louder and gave way to savage shouts and then to delirious
babblings; and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>when he
awoke he was groveling in a sand-wash and the sun had sunk in the west.</p>

<p>Once more he rose up and looked down the empty trail and across the waterless
flats; and then he raised his eyes to the eastern hills, burning red in the last
rays of the sun. They were high, very high, with pines on their summits, and
from the wash of a near canyon there lapped out a tongue of green, the promise
of water beyond. But his strength had left him now and given place to a feverish
weakness&#8211;the hills were far away, and he could only sit and wait, and if
help did not come he would perish. The solemn twilight turned to night, a star
glowed in the east; and then, on the high point above the mouth of the canyon,
there leapt up a brighter glow. It was a fire, and as he gazed he saw a form
passing before it and feeding the ruddy blaze. He rose up all a-tremble, crushed
down a brittle salt-bush and touched it off with a match; and as the resinous
wood flared up he snatched out a torch and carried the flame to another bush. It
was the signal of the lost, two fires side by side, and he gave a hoarse cry
when, from the point of the canyon, a second fire promised help. Then he sank
down in the sand, feebly feeding his signal fire, until he was roused by
galloping feet.</p>

<p>A half moon was in the sky, lighting the desert with ghostly radiance, and as
he scrambled up to look he saw a boy on a white mule, riding in with a canteen
held out. Not a word was spoken but as he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_4'></a>4</span>gurgled down the water he rolled his eyes and gazed at
his rescuer. The boy was slim and vigorous, stripped down to sandals and bib
overalls; and conspicuously on his hip he carried a heavy pistol which he
suddenly hitched to the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you give me back that
canteen.&#8221; And when the man refused he snatched it from his lips and
whipped out his ready gun. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you grab me,&#8221; he warned,
&#8220;or I&#8217;ll fill you full of lead. You&#8217;ve had enough, I tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the man faced him as if crouching for a spring; and then his
legs failed him and he sank to the ground, at which the boy dropped down and
stooped over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie still,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll bathe your
face&#8211;I was afraid you were crazy with the heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, kid,&#8221; muttered the man,
&#8220;you&#8217;re right on the job. Say, gimme another drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute&#8211;well, just a little one! Now, lie down here in the
sand and try to go to sleep.&#8221; He moistened a big handkerchief and sopped
water on his head and over his heaving chest, and after a few drinks the big
frame relaxed and the man lay sleeping like a child. But in his dreams he was
still lost and running across the desert, he started and twitched his arms; and
then he began to mutter and fumble in the sand until at last he sat up with a
jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that rock?&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;by grab,
she&#8217;s half gold&#8211;I&#8217;m going to take it and bash out his
brains!&#8221; He rose to his knees and scrambled about and the boy dropped his
hand to his gun. &#8220;I&#8217;m <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_5'></a>5</span>going to <i>kill</i> him!&#8221; raved the man,
&#8220;the danged old lizard-herder&#8211;he went off and left me to
die!&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt about in the dirt and grabbed up the chunk of quartz, which he had
lost in his last delirium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at <i>that</i>!&#8221; he exclaimed thrusting it out to the boy,
&#8220;the richest danged quartz in the world! I&#8217;ve got a ledge of it,
kid, enough to make us both rich&#8211;and John Calhoun never forgets a friend!
No, and he never forgets an enemy&#8211;the son of a goat don&#8217;t live that
can put one over on <i>me</i>! You just wait, Mister Dusty Rhodes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, was that Dusty Rhodes?&#8221; the boy piped up eagerly. &#8220;I
was watching from the point and I <i>thought</i> it was his outfit&#8211;but I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen you. Were you glad when you saw my
fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I was, kid,&#8221; the man answered gravely, &#8220;I reckon
you saved my life. My name is John C. Calhoun.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand and after a moment&#8217;s hesitation the boy reached
out and took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Billy Campbell and we live in Jail Canyon. My mother will
be coming down soon&#8211;that is, if she can catch our other mule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to meet her,&#8221; replied Calhoun still shaking his hand,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a good kid, Billy; I like you. And when your mother comes,
if it&#8217;s agreeable to her, I&#8217;d like to take you along for my pardner.
How would that suit you, now&#8211;I&#8217;ve just made a big strike and
I&#8217;ll put you right next to the discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;d like it,&#8221; stammered the boy hastily drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>his hand away,
&#8220;only&#8211;only I&#8217;m afraid my mother won&#8217;t let me. You see
the boys are all gone, and there&#8217;s lots of work to do, and&#8211;but I do
get awful lonely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it!&#8221; announced Calhoun, pausing to take another
drink, &#8220;and anything I&#8217;ve got, it&#8217;s yours. You&#8217;ve saved
my life, Billy, and I never forget a kindness&#8211;any more than I forget an
injury. Do you see that rock?&#8221; he demanded fiercely. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to follow Dusty Rhodes to the end of the world and bash out his rabbit
brains with it! I stopped up at Black Point to look at that big dyke and what do
you think he done? He went off and <i>left</i> me and never looked back until he
struck them Blackwater saloons! And the first chunk of rock that I knocked off
of that ledge would assay a thousand dollars&#8211;gold! I ran after that danged
fool until I fell down like I was dead, and then I ran after him again, but he
never so much as looked back&#8211;and all the time I was trying to make him
rich and put him next to my strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and mopped his brow, then took another drink and laughed, deep
down in his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were supposed to be prospecting,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I
threw in with him over at Furnace Creek and we never stopped hiking until we
struck the upper water at Wild Rose. How&#8217;s that for
prospecting&#8211;never looked at a rock, except them he threw at his
burros&#8211;and this morning, when I stopped, he got all bowed up and went off
and left me flat. All I had was one canteen and the makings <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>for a smoke, everything else was on the
jacks, and the first rock I knocked off was rotten with gold&#8211;he&#8217;d
been going past it for years! Well, I <i>stopped</i>! Nothing to it, when you
find a ledge like that you want to put up a notice. All my blanks were in the
pack but I located it, all the same&#8211;with some rocks and a cigarette paper.
It&#8217;ll hold, all right, according to law&#8211;it&#8217;s got my name, and
the date, and the name of the claim and how far I claim, both ways&#8211;but not
a doggoned corner nor a pick-mark on it; and there it is, right by the trail!
The first jasper that comes by is going to jump it, sure&#8211;don&#8217;t you
know, boy, I&#8217;ve got to get <i>back</i>. What&#8217;s the chances for
borrowing your mule?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;Tellurium?&#8221; faltered the boy going over to the mule
and rubbing his nose regretfully, &#8220;he&#8217;s&#8211;he&#8217;s a pet;
I&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw come on now, I&#8217;ll pay you well&#8211;I&#8217;ll stake you the
claim next to mine. That ought to be worth lots of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; returned Billy, &#8220;here&#8217;s a lunch I brought
along. I guess I&#8217;ll be going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He untied a sack of food from the back of his saddle and mounted as if to go,
but the stranger took the mule by the bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen, kid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you know who I am? Well,
I&#8217;m John C. Calhoun, the man that discovered the Wunpost Mine and put
Southern Nevada on the map. I&#8217;m no crazy man; I&#8217;m a prospector, as
good as the best, if I am playing to a little hard luck. Yes sir, I located the
Wunpost and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>started
that first big rush&#8211;they came pouring into Keno by the thousands; but when
I show &#8217;em this rock there won&#8217;t be anybody left&#8211;they&#8217;ll
come across Death Valley like a sandstorm. They&#8217;ll come pouring down that
wash like a cloudburst in July and the whole doggoned country will be located.
Don&#8217;t you want to be in on the strike? I&#8217;m giving you a chance, and
you&#8217;ll never have another one like it. All I ask is this mule, and your
canteen and the grub, and I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll
do&#8211;I&#8217;ll give you half my claim, and I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s worth
millions, and I&#8217;ll bring back your mule to boot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will you?&#8221; exclaimed the boy and was scrambling swiftly down
when he stopped with one hand on the horn. &#8220;Does&#8211;does it make any
difference if I&#8217;m a girl?&#8221; he asked with a break in his voice, and
John C. Calhoun started back. He looked again and in the desert moonlight the
boyish face seemed to soften and change. Tears sprang into the dark eyes and as
she hung her head a curl fell across her breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell&#8211;no!&#8221; he burst out hardly knowing what he said,
&#8220;not as long as I get the mule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then write out that notice for Wilhelmina Campbell&#8211;I guess
that&#8217;s my legal name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a right pretty name,&#8221; conceded Calhoun as he mounted,
&#8220;but somehow I kinder liked Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing alone in the desert, with her face bared to the moonlight and her
curls shaken free to the wind, Wilhelmina smiled softly as she gazed after the
stranger who already had won her heart. His language had been crude when he
thought she was a boy, but that only proved the perfection of her disguise; and
when she had asked if it made any difference, and confessed that she was a girl,
he had bridged over the gap like a flash. &#8220;Hell&#8211;no!&#8221; he had
said, as men oftentimes do to express the heartiest accord; and then he had
added, with the gallantry due a lady, that Wilhelmina was a right pretty name.
And tomorrow, as soon as he had staked out his claim&#8211;their claim&#8211;he
was coming back to the ranch!</p>

<p>She started back up the long wash that led down from Jail Canyon, still
musing on his masterful ways, but as she rounded the lower point and saw a light
in the house a sudden doubt assailed her. Tellurium was her mule, to give to
whom she chose, but he was matched to pull with Bodie when they needed a team
and her father might not approve. And what would she say when she met her
mother&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>eye
and she questioned her about this strange man? Yet she knew as well as anything
that he was going to make her rich&#8211;and tomorrow he would bring back the
mule. All she needed was faith, and the patience to wait; and she took her
scolding so meekly that her mother repented it and allowed her to sleep in the
tunnel.</p>

<p>The Jail Canyon Ranch lay in a pocket among the hills, so shut in by high
ridges and overhanging rimrock that it seemed like the bottom of a well; but
where the point swung in that encircled the tiny farm a tunnel bored its way
through the hill. It was the extension of a mine which in earlier days had
gophered along the hillside after gold, but now that it was closed down and
abandoned to the rats Wilhelmina had taken the tunnel for her own. It ran
through the knife-blade ridge as straight as a die, and a trail led up to its
mouth; and from the other side, where it broke out into the sun, there was a
view of the outer world. Sitting within its cool portal she could look off
across the Sink, to Blackwater and the Argus Range beyond; and by stepping
outside she could see the whole valley, from South Pass to the Death Valley
Trail.</p>

<p>It was from this tunnel that she had watched when Dusty Rhodes went past, a
moving fleck of color plumed with dust; and when the sun sank low she had seen
the form that followed, like a man yet not like a man. She had seen it rise and
fall, disappear and loom up again; until at last in the twilight she had
challenged it with a fire and the answer <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_11'></a>11</span>had led her to&#8211;him. She had found him&#8211;lost
on the desert and about to die, big and strong yet dependent upon her
aid&#8211;and when she had allowed her long curls to escape he had stood silent
in the presence of her womanhood. She wanted to run back and sleep in her
tunnel, where the air was always moving and cool; and then in the morning, when
she looked to the north, she might see the first dust of his return. She might
see his tall form, and the white sides of Tellurium as he took the shortest way
home, and then she could run back and drag her mother to the portal and prove
that her knight had been misjudged. For her mother had predicted that the
prospector would not return, and that his mine was only a blind; but she, who
had seen him and felt the clasp of his hand, she knew that he would never rob
<i>her</i>. So she fled to her dream-house, where there was nothing to check her
fancies, and slept in the tunnel-mouth till dawn.</p>

<p>The day came first in the west, galloping along the Argus Range and splashing
its peaks with red; and then as the sun ascended it found gaps in the eastern
rim and laid long bands of light across the Sink. It rose up higher and, as the
desert stood forth bare, the dweller in the dream-house stepped out through its
portals and gazed long at the Death Valley Trail. From the far north pass, where
it came down from Wild Rose, to where Blackwater sent up its thin smoke, the
trail crept like a serpent among the sandhills and washes, a long tenuous line
through the Sink. Where the ground was white <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span>the trail stood out darker, and where it crossed the
sun-burnt mesas it was white; but from one end to the other it was vacant and
nothing emerged from north pass. Billy sighed and turned away, but when she came
back there was a streak of dust to the south.</p>

<p>It came tearing along the trail from Blackwater, struck up by a galloping
horseman, and at the spot where she had found the lost man the night before the
flying rider stopped. He rode about in circles, started north and came dashing
back; and at last, still galloping, he turned up the wash and headed for the
mouth of Jail Canyon. He was some searcher who had found her tracks in the sand,
and the tracks of Tellurium going on; and, rather than follow the long trail to
Wild Rose Springs, he was coming to interview her. Billy ran down to meet him
with long, rangey strides, and at the point of the hill she stood waiting
expectantly, for visitors were rare at the ranch. Three restless lonely weeks
had dragged away without bringing a single wanderer to their doors; and now here
was a second man, fully as exciting as the first, because he was coming up there
to see <i>her</i>. Billy tucked up her curls beneath the brim of her man&#8217;s
hat as she watched the laboring horse, but when she made out who it was that was
coming she gave up all thought of disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Dusty!&#8221; she called running gayly down to meet him,
&#8220;are you looking for Mr. Calhoun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Mister, is it?&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Well, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>you seen the danged
whelp? Whoo, boy&#8211;where is he, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went back!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I lent him my mule. He told me
he&#8217;d made a rich strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rich <i>strike</i>!&#8221; repeated the man and then he laughed and
spurred his drooping mount. He was tall and bony with a thin, hawk nose and eyes
sunk deep into his head. &#8220;A rich strike, eh?&#8221; he mimicked, and then
he laughed again, until suddenly his face came straight. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that you said?&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t lend him your
<i>mule</i>! Well, I&#8217;m afraid, my little girl, you&#8217;ve made a
mistake&#8211;that feller is a regular horse-thief. Is your mother up to the
house? We&#8217;ll go up and see her&#8211;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s gone and
stole your mule!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; protested Billy confidently, running
along the trail beside him, &#8220;he went back to stake out his claim. He found
some rich ore right there at Black Point, and he&#8217;s going to give me half
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Black P&#8217;int!&#8221; whooped Dusty Rhodes doubling up in a knot to
squeeze out the last atom of his mirth, &#8220;w&#8217;y I&#8217;ve been past that
p&#8217;int for twenty years&#8211;it&#8217;s nothing but porphyry and burnt
lava! He&#8217;s crazy with the heat! Where&#8217;s your father, my little girl?
We&#8217;ll have to go out and ketch him if we ever expect to git back that
mule!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s working up the canyon,&#8221; answered Billy sulkily,
&#8220;but never you mind about my mule. He&#8217;s mine, I guess, and I loaned
him to that man in exchange for a half interest in his mine!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s a <i>mine</i> now, is it?&#8221; mocked Dusty Rhodes, &#8220;next
thing it&#8217;ll be a mine and mill. And he borrowed your mule, eh, that your
father give ye, and sent ye back home on foot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; pouted Billy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you
change your tune when you see him coming back with my mule. You went off and
left him, and if I hadn&#8217;t gone down and helped him he would have died in
the desert of thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh&#8211;eh! Went off and <i>left</i> him!&#8221; bleated Dusty in a
fury, &#8220;the poor fool went off and left <i>me</i>! I picked him up at
Furnace Crick, over in the middle of Death Valley, and jest took him along out
of pity; and all the way over he was looking at every rock when a prospector
wouldn&#8217;t spit on the place! He was eating my grub and packing his bed on
my jacks; and then, by the gods, he wants me to stop at Black P&#8217;int while he
looks at that hungry bull-quartz! I warned him distinctly that I don&#8217;t
wait for no man&#8211;did he say I went off and left him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he did,&#8221; answered Billy, &#8220;and he says he&#8217;s
going to kill you, because you went off and took all his water!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo, hoo!&#8221; jeered Dusty Rhodes, &#8220;that big bag of
wind?&#8221; But he ignored what she said about the water.</p>

<p>They spattered through the creek, where it flowed out to sink in the sand,
and passed around the point of the canyon; and then the green valley spread out
before them until it was cut off by the gorge above. This was the treacherous
Corkscrew Bend, where <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_15'></a>15</span>the fury of countless cloudbursts had polished the
granite walls like a tombstone; but Dusty Rhodes recalled the time when a fine
stage-road had threaded its curves and led on up the canyon to old Panamint. But
the flood which had destroyed the road had left the town marooned and the
inhabitants had gone out over the rocks; until now only Cole Campbell, the owner
of the Homestake, stayed on to do the work on his claims. In this valley far
below he had made his home for years, diverting the creek to water his scanty
crops; while in season and out he labored on the road which was to connect up
his mine with the world.</p>

<p>His house stood against the hill, around the point from Corkscrew Bend, old
and rambling and overgrown with vines; and along the road that led up to it
there were rows of peaches and figs, fenced off by stone walls from the creek.
Dusty rode past the trees slowly, feasting his eyes on their lush greenness and
the rank growth of alfalfa beyond; until from the house ahead a screen door
slammed and a woman gazed anxiously down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that you, Mr. Rhodes?&#8221; she called out at last, &#8220;I
thought it was the man who got lost! Come up to the house and tell me about
him&#8211;do you think he will bring back our mule?&#8221;</p>

<p>He dismounted with a flourish and dropped his reins at the gate; then, while
Billy hung back and petted the lathered horse, he strode up the flower-entangled
walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think nothing, Mrs. Campbell,&#8221; he announced <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>with decision, &#8220;that
boy has stole &#8217;em before. He&#8217;ll trade off that mule fer anything he
can git and pull his freight fer Nevada.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paced up to the porch and shook hands ceremoniously, after which he
accepted a drink and a basketful of figs and proceeded to retail the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who that feller is?&#8221; he inquired mysteriously, as
Billy crept resentfully near, &#8220;he&#8217;s the man that discovered the
Wunpost mine and tried to keep it dark. Yes, that big mine over in Keno that
they thought was worth millions, only it pinched right out at depth; but it
showed up the nicest specimens of jewelry gold that has ever been seen in these
parts. Well, this Wunpost, as they call him, was working on a grubstake for a
banker named Judson Eells. He&#8217;d been out for two years, just sitting
around the water-holes or playing coon-can with the Injuns, when he comes across
this mine, or was led to it by some Injun, and he tries to cover it up. He puts
up one post, to kinder hold it down in case some prospector should happen along;
and then he writes his notice, <i>leaving out the date</i>&#8211;and everything
else, you might say.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wunpost Mine,&#8217;&#8221; he writes, &#8220;&#8216;John C. Calhoun owner.
I claim fifteen hundred feet on this vein.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And jest to show you, Mrs. Campbell, what an ignorant fool he
is&#8211;he spelled One Post, W-u-n! That&#8217;s where he got his
name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a <i>pretty</i> name!&#8221; spoke up Billy
loyally, as her mother joined in on the laugh. &#8220;And <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span> anyhow, just because a man can&#8217;t
spell, that&#8217;s no reason for calling him a fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he <i>is</i> a fool!&#8221; burst out Dusty Rhodes spitefully,
&#8220;and more than that, he&#8217;s a crook! Now that is what he done&#8211;he
covered up that find and went back to the man that had grubstaked him. But this
banker was no sucker, if he did have the name of staking every bum in Nevada. He
was generous with his men and he give &#8217;em all they asked for, but before
he planked down a dollar he made &#8217;em sign a contract that a corporation
lawyer couldn&#8217;t break. Well, when Wunpost said he&#8217;d quit, Mr. Eells
says all right&#8211;no hard feeling&#8211;better luck next time. But when
Wunpost went back and opened up this vein Mr. Eells was Johnny-on-the-spot. He
steps up to that hole and shows his contract, giving him an equal share of
whatever Wunpost finds&#8211;and then he reads a clause giving him the right to
take possession and to work the mine according to his judgment. And the first
thing Wunpost knowed the mine was worked out and he was left holding the sack.
But served him right, sez I, for trying to beat his outfitter, after eating his
grub for two years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t he receive <i>anything</i>?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Campbell. &#8220;That seems to me pretty sharp practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a prim little woman, with honest blue eyes that sometimes made men
think of their sins, and when Dusty Rhodes perceived that he had gone a bit too
far he endeavored to justify his spleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He received <i>some</i>!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;but what good <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>did it do him? Eells give
him five hundred dollars when he demanded an accounting and he blowed it all in
in one night. He was buying the drinks for every man in camp&#8211;your money
was all counterfeit with him&#8211;and the next morning he woke up without a
shirt to his back, having had it torn off in a fight. What kind of a man is that
to be managing a mine or to be partners with a big banker like Eells? No, he
walked out of camp without a cent to his name and I picked him up Tuesday over
at Furnace Crick. All he had was his bed and a couple of canteens and a little
jerked beef in a sack, but to hear the poor boob talk you&#8217;d think he was a
millionaire&#8211;he had the world by the tail. And then, at the end of it,
he&#8217;d be borrying your tobacco&#8211;or anything else you&#8217;d got. But
I never would&#8217;ve thought that he&#8217;d steal Billy&#8217;s
mule&#8211;that&#8217;s gitting pretty low, it strikes me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never stole my mule!&#8221; burst out Wilhelmina angrily. &#8220;I
expect him back here any time. And when he does come, and you hear about his
mine, I&#8217;ll bet you change your tune!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho!&#8221; shouted Rhodes, nodding and winking at Mrs. Campbell,
&#8220;she&#8217;s getting to be growed-up, ain&#8217;t she? Last time I come
through here she was a little girl in pigtails but now it&#8217;s done up in
curls. And I can&#8217;t say a word against this no-account Wunpost till she
calls me a liar to my face!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy is almost nineteen,&#8221; answered Mrs. Campbell quietly,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m surprised to hear her contradict.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>&#8220;Well, I
didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; apologized Wilhelmina hastily,
&#8220;but&#8211;well anyhow, I <i>know</i> he&#8217;s got a mine! Because he
showed me a piece of quartz that he&#8217;d carried all the way, and he must
have had a reason for <i>that</i>. It was just moonlight, of course, and I
couldn&#8217;t see the gold, but I know that it was quartz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Billy, my little girl,&#8221; returned Dusty indulgently,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t know the boy like I do. And the world is full of quartz
but you don&#8217;t find a mine right next to a well-worn trail. Have you got
that piece of rock? Well now you see the p&#8217;int&#8211;he took it
<i>away</i>! Would he do that if his mine was on the square?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know why not,&#8221; answered Billy at last and
then she bowed her head and turned away. They gazed after her pityingly as she
ran along the ditch and up to the mouth of her tunnel, but Billy did not stop
till she had threaded its murky passageway and come out at her gate of dreams.
It was from there that she had seen him when he was lost in the Sink, and she
knew her dream of dreams would come true. He was going to come back, he was
going to bring her mule, and make her his partner in the mine. She looked
out&#8211;and there was his dust!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>DUSTY RHODES EATS DIRT</span></h2>

<p>Billy gazed away in ecstasy at the dust cloud in the distance, and at the
white spot that was Tellurium, her mule; and when the rider came closer she
skipped back through the tunnel and danced along the trail to the house. Dusty
Rhodes was still there, describing in windy detail Wunpost&#8217;s encounter
with one Pisen-face Lynch, but as she stood before them smiling he sensed the
mischief in her eye and interrupted himself with a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming,&#8221; announced Billy, showing the dimples in both
cheeks and Dusty Rhodes let his jaw drop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s coming?&#8221; he asked but she dimpled enigmatically and
jerked her curly head towards the road. They started up to look and as the white
mule rounded the point Dusty Rhodes blinked his eyes uncertainly. After all his
talk about the faithless and cowardly Wunpost here he was, coming up the road;
and the memory of a canteen which he had left strapped upon a pack, rose up and
left him cold. Talk as much as he would he could never escape the fact that he
had gone off with Wunpost&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_21'></a>21</span>big canteen, and the one subject he had
avoided&#8211;why he had not stopped to wait for him&#8211;was now likely to be
thoroughly discussed. He glanced about furtively, but there was no avenue of
escape and he started off down to the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you been all the time?&#8221; he shouted in accusing accents,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for you everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you have!&#8221; thundered Wunpost dropping down off his mule and
striding swiftly towards him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been lapping up the booze,
over at Blackwater! I&#8217;ve a good mind to kill you, you old
dastard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you not to stop?&#8221; yelled Rhodes in a feigned
fury. &#8220;You brought it all on yourself! I thought you&#8217;d gone
back&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not!&#8221; shouted Wunpost waving his fists in the air,
&#8220;you saw me behind you all the time. And if I&#8217;d ever caught up with
you I&#8217;d have bashed your danged brains out, but now I&#8217;m going to let
you live! I&#8217;m going to let you live so I can have a good laugh every time
I see you go by&#8211;Old Dusty Rhodes, the Speed King, the Wild Ass of the
Desert, the man that couldn&#8217;t stop to get rich! I was running along behind
you trying to make you a millionaire but you wouldn&#8217;t even give me a
drink! Look at <i>that</i>, what I was trying to show you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He whipped out a rock and slapped it into Rhodes&#8217; hand but Dusty was
blind with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;No good!&#8221; he said, and chucked it in the dirt at which Wunpost
stooped down and picked it up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_22'></a>22</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a peach of a prospector,&#8221; he
said with biting scorn and stored it away in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me look at that again,&#8221; spoke up Dusty Rhodes querulously
but Wunpost had spied the ladies. He advanced to the porch, his big black hat in
one hand, while he smoothed his towsled hair with the other, and the smile which
he flashed Billy made her flush and then go pale, for she had neglected to
change back to skirts. Every Sunday morning, and when they had visitors, she was
required to don the true habiliments of her sex; but her joy at his return had
left no room for thoughts of dress and she found herself in the overalls of a
boy. So she stepped behind her mother and as Wunpost observed her blushes he
addressed his remarks to Mrs. Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you,&#8221; he exclaimed with a gallantry quite
surprising in a man who could not even spell &#8220;one.&#8221; &#8220;I hope
you&#8217;ll excuse my few words with Mr. Rhodes. It&#8217;s been a long time
since I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting ladies and I forgot myself for the
moment. I met your daughter yesterday&#8211;good morning, Miss
Wilhelmina&#8211;and I formed a high opinion of you both; because a young lady
of her breeding must have a mother to be proud of, and she certainly showed she
was game. She saved my life with that water and lunch, and then she loaned me
her mule!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and Dusty Rhodes brought his bushy eyebrows down and stabbed him to
the heart with his stare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>&#8220;Lemme look
at that rock!&#8221; he demanded importantly and John C. Calhoun returned his
glare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Rhodes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;after the way you have treated me I
don&#8217;t feel that I owe you any courtesies. You have seen the rock once and
that&#8217;s enough. Please excuse me, I was talking with these
ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, you can&#8217;t fool me,&#8221; burst out Dusty Rhodes
vindictively, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t sech a winner as you think. I&#8217;ve jest
give Mrs. Campbell a bird&#8217;s-eye view of your career, so you&#8217;re
coppered on that bet from the start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Wunpost drawing himself up
arrogantly while his beetle-browed eyes flashed fire; but the challenge in his
voice did not ring absolutely true and Dusty Rhodes grinned at him wickedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better learn to spell Wunpost,&#8221; he said with a
hectoring laugh, &#8220;before you put on any more dog with the ladies. But I
asked you for that rock and I intend to git a look at it&#8211;I claim an
interest in anything you&#8217;ve found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do, eh?&#8221; returned Wunpost, now suddenly calm.
&#8220;Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Rhodes. You wasn&#8217;t in my
company when I found this chunk of rock, so you haven&#8217;t got any
interest&#8211;see? But rather than have an argument in the presence of these
ladies I&#8217;ll show you the quartz again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out the piece of rock and handed it to Rhodes who stared at it with
sun-blinded eyes&#8211;then suddenly he whipped out a case and focussed <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>a pair of magnifying
glasses meanwhile mumbling to himself in broken accents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you git that rock?&#8221; he asked, looking up, and
Wunpost threw out his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there at Black Point,&#8221; he answered carelessly,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve been chasing along by it for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; burst out Dusty gazing wildly about
and mumbling still louder in the interim. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t
possible&#8211;I&#8217;ve been right by there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps you never stopped,&#8221; suggested Wunpost sarcastically
and handed the piece of rock to Mrs. Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look in them holes,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;they&#8217;re full of
fine gold.&#8221; And then he turned to Dusty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Rhodes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t treated me
right or I&#8217;d let you in on this strike. But you went off and left me and
therefore you&#8217;re out of it, and there ain&#8217;t any extensions to stake.
It&#8217;s just a single big blow-out, an eroded volcanic cone, and I&#8217;ve
covered it all with one claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you was <i>traveling</i> with me!&#8221; yelled Rhodes dancing
about like a jay-bird, &#8220;you gimme half or I&#8217;ll have the law on
ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop to it!&#8221; invited Wunpost, &#8220;nothing would please me
better than to air this whole case in court. And I&#8217;ll bet, when I&#8217;ve
finished, they&#8217;ll take you out of court and hang you to the first tree
they find. I&#8217;ll just tell them the facts, how you went off and left me and
refused to either stop or leave me water; and then I&#8217;ll tell the judge how
this little girl came down and saved my life with her mule. I&#8217;m not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>trying to play the
hog&#8211;all I want is half the claim&#8211;but the other half goes to Billy.
Here&#8217;s the paper, Wilhelmina; I may not know how to spell but you bet your
life I know who&#8217;s my friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed over a piece of the paper bag which had been used to wrap up his
lunch, and as Wilhelmina looked she beheld a copy of the notice that he had
posted on his claim. No knight errant of old could have excelled him in
gallantry, for he had given her a full half of his claim; but her eyes filled
with tears, for here, even as at Wunpost, he had betrayed his ineptitude with
the pen. He had named the mine after her but he had spelled it &#8220;Willie
Meena&#8221; and she knew that his detractors would laugh. Yet she folded the
precious paper and thanked him shyly as he told her how to have it recorded, and
then she slipped away to gloat over it alone and look through the specimen for
gold.</p>

<p>But Dusty Rhodes, though he had been silenced for the moment, was not
satisfied with the way things had gone; and while Billy was making a change to
her Sunday clothes she heard his complaining voice from the corrals. He spoke as
to the hilltops, after the manner of mountain men or those who address
themselves to mules; and John Calhoun in turn had a truly mighty voice which
wafted every word to her ears. But as she listened, half in awe at their savage
repartee, a third but quieter voice broke in, and she leapt into her dress and
went dashing down the hill for her father had come back from the mine. He was
deaf, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>slightly
crippled, as the result of an explosion when his drill had struck into a missed
hole; but to lonely Wilhelmina he was the dearest of companions and she shouted
into his ear by the hour. And, now that he had come home, the rival claimants
were laying their case before him.</p>

<p>Dusty Rhodes was excited, for he saw the chance of a fortune slipping away
through his impotent fingers; but when Wunpost made answer he was even more
excited, for the memory of his desertion rankled deep. All the ethics of the
desert had been violated by Dusty Rhodes and a human life put in jeopardy, and
as Wunpost dwelt upon his sufferings the old thirst for revenge rose up till it
quite overmastered him. He denounced Dusty&#8217;s actions in no uncertain
terms, holding him up to the scorn of mankind; but Dusty was just as vehement in
his impassioned defense and in his claim to a half of the strike. There the
ethics of the desert came in again; for it is a tradition in mining, not
unsupported by sound law, that whoever is with a man at the time of a discovery
is entitled to half the find. And the hold-over from his drinking bout of the
evening before made Dusty unrestrained in his protests.</p>

<p>The battle was at its height when Wilhelmina arrived and gave her father a
hug and as the contestants beheld her, suddenly transformed to a young lady,
they ceased their accusations and stood dumb. She was a child no longer, as she
had appeared in the bib overalls, but a woman and with all a woman&#8217;s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>charm. Her eyes were very
bright, her cheeks a ruddy pink, her curls a glorious halo for her head; and,
standing beside her father, she took on a naïve dignity that left the two
fire-eaters abashed. Cole Campbell himself was a man to be reckoned
with&#8211;tall and straight as an arrow, with eyes that never wavered and
decision in every line of his face. His gray hair stood up straight above a brow
furrowed with care and his mustache bristled out aggressively, but as he glanced
down at his daughter his stern eyes suddenly softened and he acknowledged her
presence with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they telling you about the strike?&#8221; she called into his ear
and he nodded and smiled again. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up there!&#8221; she
proposed but he shook his head and turned to the expectant contestants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentleman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as near as I can make out Mr.
Rhodes <i>has</i> a certain right in the property. Mr. Calhoun was traveling with
him and eating his grub, and I believe a court of law would decide in his favor
even if he did go off and leave him in the lurch. But since my daughter picked
him up and supplied him with a mule to go back and stake out the claim it might
be that she also has an equity in the property, although that is for you
gentlemen to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s decided already!&#8221; shouted Wunpost angrily,
&#8220;the claim has been located in her name. She&#8217;s entitled to one-half
and no burro-chasing prospector is going to beat her out of any part of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps,&#8221; suggested Campbell with a quick <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>glance at his daughter,
&#8220;perhaps she would consent to take a third. And if you would do the same
that would be giving up only one sixth and yet it would obviate a
lawsuit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll sue him!&#8221; yammered Rhodes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
fight him to a whisper! I&#8217;ll engage the best lawyers in the country! And
if I can&#8217;t git it no other way&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221; commanded Campbell raising his hand for
peace, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing to be gained by threats. This can all be
arranged if you&#8217;ll just keep your heads and try to consider it
impartially. I&#8217;m surprised, Mr. Rhodes, that you abandoned your pardner
and left him without water on the desert. I&#8217;ve known you a long time and
I&#8217;ve always respected you, but the fact would be against you in court. But
on the other hand you can prove that you rode out this morning and made a
diligent search, and that in itself would probably disprove abandonment,
although I can&#8217;t say it counts for much with me. But you&#8217;ve asked my
opinion, gentlemen, and there it is; and my advice is to settle this matter
right now without taking the case into court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give him half of my share,&#8221; broke out Wunpost
fretfully, &#8220;but I promised Billy half and she is going to get half&#8211;I
gave her my word, and that goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll give him half of mine,&#8221; cried Billy to her
father, &#8220;because all I did was lend him Tellurium. But before I agree to
it Mr. Rhodes has <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>got
to apologize, because he said he&#8217;d steal my mule!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired her father holding his ear down
closer, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite get that last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dusty Rhodes came up here to look for Mr. Calhoun, and when I
told him that I had loaned him my mule he said Mr. Calhoun would
<i>steal</i> him! And then he went up and told Mother all about it and said that
Mr. Calhoun would do <i>anything</i>, and he said he&#8217;d probably take
Tellurium to Wild Rose and trade him off to some <i>squaw</i>! And when I
defended him he just whooped and laughed at me&#8211;and now he&#8217;s got to
<i>apologise</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted a hateful glance at the perspiring Dusty Rhodes, who was vainly
trying to get Campbell&#8217;s ear; and at the end of her recital there was a
look in Wunpost&#8217;s eye that spoke of reprisals to come. The fat was in the
fire, as far as Rhodes was concerned, but he surprised them all by retracting.
He apologized in haste, before Wunpost could make a reach for him, and then he
recanted in detail, and when the tumult was over they had signed a joint
agreement to give him one third of the mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, boys,&#8221; he yelled, thrusting his copy into his pocket
and making a dash for his horse. &#8220;One third! It&#8217;s all right with me!
But if we&#8217;d gone to the courts I&#8217;d got half, sure as shooting! &#8217;Sall
right, but just watch my dust!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TREE OF LIFE</span></h2>

<p>As the evening came on they walked out together, Wunpost and the worshipful
Wilhelmina, and from the portals of her House of Dreams they looked out over the
Sink where they had met but the evening before. Less than a single day had
passed since their stars had crossed, and already they were talking of life and
eternal friendship and of all the great dreams that youth loves. Each had given
of what they had without counting the cost or considering what others might say;
and now they walked together like reunited lovers, though their friendship was
not twenty-four hours old. Yet in that single eventful day what a gamut they had
run of the emotions which make up the soul&#8217;s life&#8211;of dangers boldly
met, of mutual sacrifice and trust and the joys of vindication and success. They
had staked all they had in the greatest game in life and, miracle of miracles,
they had won. They had sought out each other&#8217;s souls in the murk of death
and doubt and each had been proven pure gold; yet even youth, for all its
madness, has its moments of clairvoyance and Billy sensed that her joy could not
last. It was too great, too perfect, to endure forever, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>and as she gazed across the desert she
sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; inquired Wunpost who, after a few
hours&#8217; sleep, had awakened in a most expansive mood; but she only sighed
again and shook her head and gazed off across the quivering Sink. It was a
hell-hole of torment to those who crossed its moods and yet in that waste she
had found this man, who had changed her whole outlook on life. He had come up
from the desert, a sun-bronzed young giant, volcanic in his loves and his hates;
and on the morrow the desert would claim him again, for he was going back to his
mine. And her father was going, too&#8211;Jail Canyon would be as empty as it
had been for many a long year&#8211;and she who longed to live, to plunge into
the swirl of life, would be left there alone, to dream.</p>

<p>But what would dreams be after she had tasted the bitter-sweet of living and
learned what it was that she missed; the tug of strong emotions, the hopes and
fears and heartaches that are the fruits of the great Tree of Life? She wanted
to pluck the fruits, be they bitter or sweet, and drain the world&#8217;s wine
to the dregs; and then, if life went ill, she could return to her House with
something about which to dream. But now she only sighed and Wunpost took her
hand and drew her down beside him in the shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about <i>him</i> kid?&#8221; he observed
mysteriously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of him, all right. And don&#8217;t you
believe a word he said about me stealing horses and such. I&#8217;m a little
rough sometimes when <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
these jaspers try to rob me, but I never take advantage of a friend. I&#8217;m a
Kentucky Calhoun, related to John Caldwell Calhoun, the great orator who debated
with Webster; and a Kentucky Calhoun never forgets a kindness nor forgives an
intentional injury. Dusty Rhodes thinks he&#8217;s smart, getting a third of our
mine after he went off and left me flat; but I&#8217;ll show that old walloper
before I get through with him that he can&#8217;t put one over on me. And
there&#8217;s a man over in Nevada that&#8217;s going to learn the same thing as
soon as I make my stake&#8211;he&#8217;s another smart Aleck that thinks he can
job me and get away with highway robbery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that Judson Eells?&#8221; broke in Billy quickly and Wunpost
nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hombre,&#8221; he said his voice waxing louder,
&#8220;he&#8217;s one of these grubstake sharks. He came to Nevada after the
Tonopah excitement with a flunkey they call Flip Flappum. That&#8217;s another
dirty dog that I&#8217;m going to put my mark on when I get him in the
door&#8211;one of the most low-down, contemptible curs that I know of&#8211;he
makes his living by selling bum life insurance. Phillip F. Lapham is his name
but we all call him Flip Flappum&#8211;he&#8217;s the black-leg lawyer that drew
up that contract that made me lose my mine. Did Dusty tell you about
it&#8211;then he told you a lie&#8211;I never even read the cussed contract! I
was broke, to tell you the truth, and I&#8217;d have signed my own death warrant
to get the price of a plate of beans; and so <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_33'></a>33</span>I put my name in the place where he told me and never
thought nothing about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a grubstake, that&#8217;s all I knew, giving him half of what I
staked in exchange for what I could eat; but it turned out afterwards it was
like these fire insurance policies, where a man never reads the fine print.
There was more jokers in that contract than in a tinhorn gambler&#8217;s deck of
cards&#8211;he had me peoned for life&#8211;and after I&#8217;d given him half
my strike he came out and claimed it all. Well, no man would stand for that but
when I went to make a kick there was a rat-faced guard there waiting for me.
Pisen-face Lynch they call him, and if he was half as bad as he looks he&#8217;d
be the wild wolf of the world; but he ain&#8217;t, not by a long shot, he just
had the drop on me, and he run me off my own claim! I came back and they ganged
me and when I woke up I looked like I&#8217;d been through a barbed-wire
fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after that, as the nigger says, I began to think they
didn&#8217;t want me around there, and so I pulled my freight; and it
wasn&#8217;t a month afterwards that the ore all pinched out and left Judson
Eells belly up. If he lost one dollar I&#8217;ll bet he lost fifty thousand,
besides tipping his hand on that contract; and I walked clean back from the
lower end of Death Valley just to see how his lip was hung. He&#8217;s a big,
fat slob, and when times are good he goes around with his lip pulled up, so! But
this time he looked like an old muley cow that&#8217;s come through <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>a long, late
spring&#8211;his lip was plumb down on his brisket. So I gave him the
horse-laugh, paid my regards to Flip and Lynch, and came away feeling fine.
Because I&#8217;ll tell you Billy, sure as God made little fishes, there&#8217;s
a hereafter coming to them three men; and I&#8217;m the boy that&#8217;s going
to deal &#8217;em the misery&#8211;you wait, and watch my smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled benevolently into Billy&#8217;s startled eyes, and as the subject
seemed to interest her he settled himself more comfortably and proceeded with
his views on life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put a torch under them,
that&#8217;ll burn &#8217;em off the face of the earth. Did you ever see a
banker that wasn&#8217;t a regular robber&#8211;with special attention to widows
and orphans? Well, take it from me, Billy, they&#8217;re a bunch of
crooks&#8211;I guess I ought to know. I was just eleven years old when they
foreclosed the mortgage and turned my mother and us kids into the street; and
since then I&#8217;ve done everything from punching cows to highway robbery but
I&#8217;ve never forgot those bankers. That&#8217;s how come I signed up with
Judson Eells, I thought I was sticking him good; but he was playing a system and
they didn&#8217;t anybody tumble to it until I discovered the Wunpost.</p>

<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, there wasn&#8217;t a prospector in the state of Nevada that
hadn&#8217;t worked old Eells for a grubstake. We thought he was easy, kind of
bugs on mining like all the rest of these nuts, but the minute I struck the
Wunpost&#8211;<i>bing</i>, he&#8217;s there with his contract and we find where
we&#8217;ve all been stung. We&#8217;re <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_35'></a>35</span>tied up, by grab, with more whereases and wherefores,
and the parties of the first part, and so on, than you&#8217;d find in a book of
law; and the boys all found out from what he did to me that he had us euchered
at every turn. I thought I could fool him by covering up the
hole&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did you do that!&#8221; burst out Billy reproachfully, &#8220;and
I made Dusty Rhodes apologize!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Wunpost, &#8220;that was nothing but jaw-bone.
He just said it to get a share in our mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but listen,&#8221; protested Billy, &#8220;that isn&#8217;t what I
mean. Do you think it was right to deceive Eells?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it <i>right</i>, kid!&#8221; laughed Wunpost. &#8220;That
ain&#8217;t nothing to what I&#8217;m <i>going</i> to do if I ever get the
chance. Didn&#8217;t he hire that black-leg lawyer to draw up a cinch contract
with the purpose of grabbing all I found? Well then, that shows how honest
<i>he</i> was&#8211;and now I&#8217;m out after his scalp. I&#8217;ve got to
raise a stake, so I can fight him dollar for dollar; and then, sure as shooting,
I&#8217;m going to bust his bank and make him walk out of camp. Was it
right&#8211;say, that&#8217;s a good one&#8211;you ain&#8217;t been around much,
have you? Well, that&#8217;s all right, Billy; I like you, all the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded approvingly and Billy sat staring, for her world had gone
topsy-turvy again. She had wanted to leave Jail Canyon and go out into the
world, but was it possible that there existed a state of society where there was
no right and wrong? <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_36'></a>36</span>She sat thinking a minute, her head in a whirl, and
then she came back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when you covered up this mine and tried to keep it for yourself,
he&#8211;had Mr. Eells ever done you any harm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not yet, kid&#8211;that is, I didn&#8217;t know it&#8211;but
believe me, his intentions were good. The time hadn&#8217;t come, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was your friend, then,&#8221; contended Billy, &#8220;because Dusty
Rhodes said&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dusty Rhodes!&#8221; bellowed Wunpost and then he paused. &#8220;Go
on, let&#8217;s get this off your chest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he said,&#8221; continued Billy, &#8220;that Mr. Eells gave you
everything and that you lived off his grubstake for two years; so I don&#8217;t
think it was right, when you finally found a mine&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, listen,&#8221; broke in Wunpost leaning over and tapping her on
the knee while he fixed her with intolerant eyes, &#8220;who&#8217;s your
friend, now&#8211;Dusty Rhodes or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;you are,&#8221; faltered Billy, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
see&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; pronounced Wunpost, &#8220;if I&#8217;m your
friend, <i>stay with me</i>. Don&#8217;t tell me what Dusty Rhodes
said!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she defended, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I
make him apologize? But I&#8217;m <i>your</i> friend, too, and I don&#8217;t
think it was right&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; thundered Wunpost, &#8220;where do you get this
&#8216;right&#8217; stuff? Have you lived up this canyon <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>all your life? Well, you wait until
tomorrow, when the rush is on, and I&#8217;ll show you how much <i>right</i>
there is in mining! You come down to the mine and I&#8217;ll show you a bunch of
mugs that would rob you of your claim like <i>that</i>! I&#8217;m going to be
there, myself, and I&#8217;m going to borrow that pistol that you stuck in my
ribs the other night; and the first yap that touches a corner or crosses my line
I&#8217;ll make him hard to catch. And then will come the promoters, with their
diamonds and certified checks, and they&#8217;ll offer you millions and
millions; but you stay with me, kid, if they offer you the sub-treasury, because
they&#8217;ll clean you if you ever sign up. Don&#8217;t sign nothing,
see&#8211;and don&#8217;t promise anything, either; and I&#8217;ll tell you
about <i>me</i>, I&#8217;ll do anything for a friend&#8211;but that&#8217;s as
far as I go. They ain&#8217;t no right and wrong, as far as I&#8217;m concerned.
I&#8217;m like a danged Injun, I&#8217;ll keep my word to a friend no matter how
the cards fall; but if that friend turns against me I&#8217;ll scalp him like
<i>that</i>, and hang his hide on the fence! So now you know right where
you&#8217;ll find me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right,&#8221; retorted Billy, whose Scotch blood was up,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you right where you&#8217;ll find <i>me</i>.
I&#8217;ll stay with my friends whether they&#8217;re right or wrong, but
I&#8217;ll never do anything dishonest. And if you don&#8217;t like that you can
take back your claim because&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I like it!&#8221; cried Wunpost, laughing and patting her hand,
&#8220;that&#8217;s just the kind of a friend <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_38'></a>38</span>I want. But all the same, Billy, this is no Sunday
School picnic&#8211;it&#8217;s more like a dog fight we&#8217;re going
to&#8211;and the only way to stand off that bunch of burglars is to hit
&#8217;em with anything you&#8217;ve got. You&#8217;ve got to grab with both
hands and kick with both feet if you want to win in this mining game; and when
you try to fight honest you&#8217;re tying one hand behind you, because some of
&#8217;em won&#8217;t stop at murder. Eells and Flip Flap and their kind
don&#8217;t pretend to be honest, they just get by with the law; and if you give
&#8217;em the edge they&#8217;ll soak you in the jaw the first time you turn
your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; returned Billy, &#8220;my father is
honest and nobody ever robbed him of his claim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooh! Who wants it?&#8221; jeered Wunpost arrogantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
talking about a real mine. Your old man&#8217;s claims are stuck up in a canyon
where a flying machine couldn&#8217;t hardly go and about the time he gets his
road built another cloudburst will come along and wash it away. Oh, don&#8217;t
talk to me, I <i>know</i>&#8211;I&#8217;ve been all along those peaks and right
down past his mine&#8211;and I tell you it isn&#8217;t worth
stealing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve been up there, too, and helped pack out the ore, and I
tell you you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s eyes flashed dangerously as she sprang up to face him and for a
minute they matched their wills; then Wunpost laughed shortly and stepped out
into the open where the sun was just topping the mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;Well all
right, kid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have your own way about it. It makes no
difference to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess not,&#8221; retorted Billy, &#8220;or you&#8217;d find out
what you were talking about before you said that my father was a fool. His mine
is just as good as it ever was&#8211;all it needs is another road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and then <i>another</i> road,&#8221; chimed in Wunpost mockingly,
&#8220;as soon as the first cloudburst comes by. And the price of silver is just
half what it was when Old Panamint was on the boom. But that makes no
difference, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does,&#8221; acknowledged Billy whose eyes were gray with
rage, &#8220;but the flotation process is so much cheaper than milling that it
more than evens things up. And there hasn&#8217;t been a cloudburst in thirteen
years&#8211;but that makes no difference, of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>She spat it out spitefully and Wunpost curbed his wit for he saw where his
jesting was leading to. When it came to her father this unsophisticated child
would stand up and fight like a wildcat. And he began to perceive too that she
was not such a child&#8211;she was a woman, with the experience of a child. In
the ways of the world she was a mere babe in the woods but in intellect and
character she was far from being dwarfed and her honesty was positively
embarrassing. It crowded him into corners that were hard to get out of and
forced him to make excuses for himself, whereas at the moment he was all lit up
with joy over the miracle of his second big strike. He had discovered the
Wunpost, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>and lost it
on a fluke; but the Willie Meena was different&#8211;if he kept the peace with
her they would both come out with a fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind now, kid,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;your father is all
right&#8211;I like him. And if he thinks he can get rich by building roads up
the canyon, that&#8217;s his privilege; it&#8217;s nothing to me. But you string
along with me on our mine down below and there&#8217;ll be money and to spare
for us both; and then you can take your share and build the old man a road
that&#8217;ll make &#8217;em all take notice! About twenty thousand dollars
ought to fix the matter up, but if we get to gee-hawing and Dusty Rhodes mixes
in there won&#8217;t be a dollar for any of us. We&#8217;ve got to stand
together, see&#8211;you and me against old Dusty&#8211;and that will give us
control.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t start the quarrel,&#8221; said Billy, beginning
to blink, &#8220;but it makes me mad, just because father won&#8217;t give up to
have everybody saying he&#8217;s crazy. But he isn&#8217;t&#8211;he knows just
exactly what he&#8217;s doing&#8211;and some day he&#8217;ll be a rich man when
these Blackwater pocket-miners are destitute. The Homestake mine produced half a
million dollars, the second time they opened it up, and if the road hadn&#8217;t
washed out it would be producing yet and my father would be rated a millionaire.
If he would sell out his claims, or just organize a company and give outside
capitalists control&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it!&#8221; warned Wunpost, who made a very poor
listener, &#8220;they&#8217;ll skin you, every time. The party that has control
can take over the property <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_41'></a>41</span>and exclude the minority stockholders from the ground,
and all they can do is to sue for an accounting and demand a look at the books.
But the books are nothing, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s underground that counts, and
if you try to go down they can kill you. I learned that from Judson Eells when
he put me out of Wunpost&#8211;and say, we can work that on Dusty! We&#8217;ll
treat him white at first, but the minute he gets gay, it&#8217;s the
gate&#8211;we&#8217;ll give him the gate!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pranced about joyously, vainly trying to make her smile, but Wilhelmina
had lost her gaiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;let&#8217;s not do that&#8211;because I
made him apologize, you know. But don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s possible that
Judson Eells will follow after you and claim this mine too, under his
contract?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t!&#8221; chuckled Wunpost starting to do a
double-shuffle, &#8220;I fooled him&#8211;this isn&#8217;t Nevada. And when I
found the Wunpost I was eating his grub, but this time I was strictly on my own.
I came to a country where I&#8217;d never been before, so he couldn&#8217;t say
I&#8217;d covered it up; and that contract was made out in the state of Nevada,
but this is clear over in California. Not a chance, kid, we&#8217;re rich, cheer
up!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to grab her hand but she drew it away from him and an anxious look
crept into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;let&#8217;s not be foolish.&#8221; Already
the great dream had sped.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WILLIE MEENA</span></h2>

<p>The morning had scarcely dawned when Wilhelmina dashed up the trail and
looked down on the Sink below; and Wunpost had been right, where before all was
empty, now the Death Valley Trail was alive. From Blackwater to Wild Rose Wash
the dust rose up in clouds, each streamer boring on towards the north; and
already the first stampeders had passed out of sight in their rush for the Black
Point strike. It lay beyond North Pass, cut off from view by the shoulder of a
long, low ridge; but there it was, and her claim and Wunpost&#8217;s was already
swarming with men. The whole town of Blackwater had risen up in the night and
gone streaking across the Sink, and what was to keep those envious pocket-miners
from claiming the find for their own? And Dusty Rhodes&#8211;he must have led
the stampede&#8211;had he respected his partners&#8217; rights? She gazed a long
moment, then darted back through the tunnel and bore the news to her father and
Wunpost.</p>

<p>He had slept in the hay, this hardy desert animal, this shabby, penniless man
with the loud voice of a demagogue and the profile of a bronze Greek god; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>and he came forth boldly,
like Odysseus of old when, cast ashore on a strange land, he roused from his
sleep and beheld Nausicaa and her maidens at play. But as Nausicaa, the
princess, withstood his advance when all her maidens had fled, so Wilhelmina
faced him, for she knew full well now that he was not a god. He was a water-hole
prospector who for two idle years had eaten the bread of Judson Eells; and then,
when chance led him to a rich vein of ore, had covered up the hole and said
nothing. Yet for all his human weaknesses he had one godlike quality, a regal
disregard for wealth; for he had kept his plighted word and divided, half and
half, this mine towards which all Blackwater now rushed. She looked at him again
and her rosy lips parted&#8211;he had earned the meed of a smile.</p>

<p>The day had dawned auspiciously, as far as Billy was concerned, for she was
back in her overalls and her father had consented to take her along to the mine.
The claim was part hers and Wunpost had insisted that she accompany them back to
the strike. Dusty Rhodes would be there, with his noisy demands and his hints at
greater rights in the claim; and in the first wild rush complications might
arise that would call for a speedy settlement. But with Billy at his side and
Cole Campbell as a witness, every detail of their agreement could be proved on
the instant and the Willie Meena started off right. So Wunpost smiled back when
he beheld the make-believe boy who had come to his aid on her mule; and as they
rode off down the canyon, driving four <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_44'></a>44</span>burros, two packed with water, he looked her over
approvingly.</p>

<p>In skirts she had something of the conventional reserve which had always made
him scared of women; but as a boy, as Billy, she was one partner in a thousand,
and as carefree as the wind. Upon the back of her saddle, neatly tied up in a
bag, she carried the dress that she would wear at the mine; but riding across
the mesa on the lonely Indian trail she clung to the garb of utility. In
overalls she had ridden up and down the corkscrew canyon that led to her
father&#8217;s mine; she had gone out to hunt for burros, dragged in wood and
carried up water and done the daily duties of a man. Both her brothers were
gone, off working in the mines, and their tasks descended to her; until in
stride and manner and speech she was by instinct, a man and only by thought a
woman.</p>

<p>The years had slipped by, even her mother had hardly noticed how she too had
grown up like the rest; and now in one day she had stepped forth into their
councils and claimed her place as a man. Yes, that was the place that she had
instinctively claimed but they had given her the place of a woman. When it came
to prospecting among the lonely peaks she could go as far as she chose; but in
the presence of men, even as an owner in the great mine, she must confine her
free limbs within skirts. And, though she had come of age, she was still in
tutelage&#8211;with two men along to do her thinking. Wunpost had made it easy,
all she had to do was stand pat and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_45'></a>45</span>agree to whatever he said; and her father was there to
protect her in her rights and preserve the family honor from loose tongues.</p>

<p>They skirted the edge of the valley, keeping up above the Sink and crossing
an endless series of rocky washes, until as they topped the last low ridge the
Black Point lay before them, surrounded by a swarm of digging men. It jutted out
from the ridge, a round volcanic cone sticking up through the shattered
porphyry; and yet this point of rock, all but buried in the wash of centuries,
held a treasure fit to ransom a king. It held the Willie Meena mine, which had
lain there by the trail while thousands of adventurers hurried past; until at
last Wunpost had stopped to examine it and had all but perished of thirst. But
one there was who had seen him, and saved him from the Sink, and loaned him her
mule to ride; and in honor of her, though he could not spell her name, he had
called it the Willie Meena.</p>

<p>Billy sat on Tellurium and gazed with rapt wonder at the scene which
stretched out below. Wagons and horses everywhere, and automobiles too, and
dejected-looking burros and mules; and in the rough hills beyond men were
climbing like goats as they staked the lava-crowned buttes. A procession of
Indian wagons was filing up the gulch to haul water from Wild Rose Spring and
already the first tent of what would soon be a city was set up opposite the
point. In a few hours there would be twenty up, in a few days a hundred, in a
few months it would be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_46'></a>46</span>a town; and all named for her, who had been given a
half by Wunpost and yet had hardly murmured her thanks. She turned to him
smiling but as she was about to speak her father caught her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put on your dress,&#8221; he said, and she retired, red with chagrin,
to struggle into that accursed badge of servitude. It was hot, the sun boiled
down as it does every day in that land where the rocks are burned black; and,
once she was dressed, she could not mount her mule without seeming to be
immodest. So she followed along behind them, leading Tellurium by his rope, and
entered her city of dreams unnoticed. Calhoun strode on before her, while
Campbell rounded up the burros, and the men from Blackwater stared at him. He
was a stranger to them all, but evidently not to boom camps, for he headed for
the solitary tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning to you, gentlemen,&#8221; he called out in his great
voice; &#8220;won&#8217;t you join me&#8211;let&#8217;s all have a
drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd fell in behind him, another crowd opened up in front, and he stood
against the bar, a board strewn thick with glasses and tottering bottles of
whiskey. An old man stood behind it, wagging his beard as he chewed tobacco, and
as he set out the glasses he glanced up at Wunpost with a curious, embittered
smile. He was white-faced and white-bearded, stooped and gnarled like a
wind-tortured tree, and the crook to his nose made one think instinctively of
pictures of the Wandering Jew. Or <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_47'></a>47</span>perhaps it was the black skull-cap, set far back on
his bent head, which gave him the Jewish cast; but his manner was that of the
rough-and-ready barkeeper and he slapped one wet hand on the bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to her!&#8221; cried Wunpost, ignoring the hint to pay as
he raised his glass to the crowd. &#8220;Here&#8217;s to the Willie
Meena&#8211;some mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tossed off the drink, but when he looked for the chaser the barkeeper
shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No chasers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;water is too blasted
scarce&#8211;that&#8217;ll be three dollars and twenty-five cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge it to ground-rent!&#8221; grinned Wunpost. &#8220;I&#8217;m the
man that owns this claim. See you later&#8211;where&#8217;s Dusty
Rhodes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;<i>cash</i>!&#8221; demanded the barkeeper, looking him
coldly in the eye. &#8220;I&#8217;m in on this claim myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since when?&#8221; inquired Wunpost. &#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t know
who I am? I am John C. Calhoun, the man that discovered Wunpost; and unless
I&#8217;m greatly mistaken you&#8217;re not in on anything&#8211;who gave you
any title to this ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dusty Rhodes,&#8221; croaked the saloon-keeper, and a curse slipped
past Wunpost&#8217;s lips, though he knew that a lady was near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, damn Dusty Rhodes!&#8221; he cried in a passion. &#8220;Where is
the crazy fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>He burst from the crowd just as Dusty came hurrying across from where he had
been digging out ore; and for a minute they stood clamoring, both <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>shouting at once, until at
last Wunpost seized him by the throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this old stiff with whiskers?&#8221; he yelled into his
ear, &#8220;that thinks he owns the whole claim? Speak up, or I&#8217;ll wring
your neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>He released his hold and Dusty Rhodes staggered back, while the crowd looked
on in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, that&#8217;s Whiskers,&#8221; explained Dusty, &#8220;the
saloon-keeper down in Blackwater. I guess I didn&#8217;t tell you but he give me
a grubstake and so he gits half my claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Your</i> claim!&#8221; echoed Wunpost. &#8220;Since when was this
your claim? You doddering old tarrapin, you only own one-third of it&#8211;and
that ain&#8217;t yours, by rights. How much do you claim, I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y&#8211;I only claim one third,&#8221; responded Dusty weakly,
&#8220;but Whiskers, he claims that I&#8217;m entitled to a
half&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A half!&#8221; raged Wunpost, starting back towards the saloon.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll show the old billygoat what he owns!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kicked over the bar with savage destructiveness, jerking up a tent-peg
with each brawny hand, and as the old man cowered he dragged the tent forward
until it threatened every moment to come down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git out of here!&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;git off of my ground! I
discovered this claim and it&#8217;s located in my name&#8211;now git, before I
break you in two!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; broke in Cole Campbell, laying a hand on
Wunpost&#8217;s arm as the saloon-keeper began <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_49'></a>49</span>suddenly to beg, &#8220;let&#8217;s not have any
violence. What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this old spittoon-trammer,&#8221; began Wunpost in a fury,
&#8220;has got the nerve to claim half my ground. I&#8217;ve been beat out of
one claim, but this time it&#8217;s different&#8211;I&#8217;ll show him who owns
this ground!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just claim a quarter of it!&#8221; snapped old Whiskers
vindictively. &#8220;I claim half of Dusty Rhodes&#8217; share. He was working
on my grubstake&#8211;and he was with you when you made your strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not!&#8221; denied Wunpost, &#8220;he went off and left me. Did
you find his name on the notice? No, you found John C. Calhoun and Williemeena
Campbell, the girl that loaned me her mule. We&#8217;re the locators of this
property, and, just to keep the peace, we agreed to give Dusty one third; but
that ain&#8217;t a half and if you say it is again, out you go&#8211;I&#8217;ll
throw you off my claim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a third, then,&#8221; screeched Old Whiskers, holding his hands
about his ears, &#8220;but for cripes&#8217; sake quit jerking that tent!
Ain&#8217;t a third enough to give me a right to put up my tent on the
ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is if I say so,&#8221; replied Wunpost authoritatively, &#8220;and
if Williemeena Campbell consents. But git it straight now&#8211;we&#8217;re
running this property and you and Dusty are <i>nothing</i>. You&#8217;re the
minority, see, and if you make a crooked move we&#8217;ll put you both off the
claim. Can you git that through your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess so,&#8221; grumbled Whiskers, stooping <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>to straighten up his bar,
and Wunpost winked at the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set &#8217;em up again!&#8221; he commanded regally and all Blackwater
drank on the house.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>CINCHED</span></h2>

<p>Having established his rights beyond the peradventure of a doubt, the
imperious Wunpost left Old Whiskers to recoup his losses and turned to the
wide-eyed Wilhelmina. She had been standing, rooted to the earth, while he
assaulted Old Whiskers and Rhodes; and as she glanced up at him doubtfully he
winked and grinned back at her and spoke from behind the cover of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the system!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Git the jump on
&#8217;em&#8211;treat &#8217;em rough! Come on, let&#8217;s go look at our
mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to Black Point, where the bonanza vein of quartz came down and
was buried in the sand; and while the crowd gazed from afar they looked over
their property, though Billy moved like one in a dream. Her father was engaged
in placating Dusty Rhodes and in explaining their agreement to the rest, and she
still felt surprised that she had ever consented to accompany so desperate a
ruffian. Yet as he knocked off a chunk of ore and showed her the specks of gold,
scattered through it with such prodigal richness, she felt her old sense of
security return; for he had never been rough with <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>her. It was only with Old Whiskers, the
grasping Blackwater saloon-keeper, and with the equally avaricious Dusty
Rhodes&#8211;who had been trying to steal more than their share of the prospect
and to beat her out of her third. They had thought to ignore her, to brush her
aside and usurp her share in the claim; but Wunpost had defended her and
protected her rights and put them back where they belonged. And it was for this
that he had seized Dusty Rhodes by the throat and kicked down the
saloon-keeper&#8217;s bar. But she wondered what would happen if, at some future
time, she should venture to oppose his will.</p>

<p>The vein of quartz which had caught Wunpost&#8217;s eye was enclosed within
another, not so rich, and a third mighty ledge of low-grade ore encased the two
of them within its walls. This big dyke it was which formed the backbone of the
point, thrusting up through the half-eroded porphyry; and as it ran up towards
its apex it was swallowed and overcapped by the lava from the old volcanic
cone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost, knocking off chunk after
chunk; and as a crowd began to gather he dug down on the richest streak, giving
the specimens to the first person who asked. The heat beat down upon them and
Campbell called Wilhelmina to the shelter of his makeshift tent, but on the
ledge Wunpost dug on untiringly while the pocket-miners gathered about. They
knew, if he did not, the value of those rocks which he dispensed like so much
dirt, and when he was not looking they gathered up the leavings and even knocked
off more for themselves. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_53'></a>53</span>There had been hungry times in the Blackwater
district, and some of this quartz was half gold.</p>

<p>An Indian wood-hauler came down from Wild Rose Spring with his wagon filled
with casks of water, and as he peddled his load at two-bits a bucket the camp
took on a new lease of life. Old Whiskers served a chaser with each drink of
whiskey; coffee was boiled and cooking began; and all the drooping horses were
banded together and driven up the canyon to the spring. It was only nine miles,
and the Indians would keep on hauling, but already Wunpost had planned to put in
a pipe-line and make Willie Meena a town. He stood by Campbell&#8217;s tent
while the crowd gathered about and related the history of his strike, and then
he went on with his plans for the mine and his predictions of boom times to
come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you wait,&#8221; he said, bulking big in the moonlight;
&#8220;you wait till them Nevada boomers come. Things are dead over
there&#8211;Keno and Wunpost are worked out; they&#8217;ll hit for this camp to
a man. And when they come, gentlemen, you want to be on your ground, because
they&#8217;ll jump anything that ain&#8217;t held down. Just wait till they see
this ore and then watch their dust&#8211;they&#8217;ll stake the whole country
for miles&#8211;but I&#8217;ve only got one claim, and I&#8217;m going to stay
on it, and the first man that jumps it will get this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slapped the big pistol that he had borrowed from Wilhelmina and nodded
impressively to the crowd; and the next morning early he was over at the hole,
getting ready for the rush that was to come. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_54'></a>54</span>For the news of the strike had gone out from
Blackwater on the stage of the evening before, and the moment it reached the
railroad it would be wired to Keno and to Tonopah and Goldfield beyond. Then the
stampede would begin, over the hills and down into Death Valley and up Emigrant
Wash to the springs; and from there the first automobiles would burn up the
ground till they struck Wild Rose Canyon and came down. Wunpost got out a hammer
and drill, and as he watched for the rush he dug out more specimens to show.
Wilhelmina stood beside him, putting the best of them into an ore-sack and
piling the rest on the dump; and as he met her glad smile he laid down his tools
and nodded at her wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big doings, kid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s some rock
that&#8217;ll make &#8217;em scream. D&#8217;ye remember what I said about Dusty
Rhodes? Well, maybe I didn&#8217;t call the turn&#8211;he did just exactly what
I said. When he got to Blackwater he claimed the strike was his and framed it up
with Whiskers to freeze us out. They thought they had us jumped&#8211;somebody
knocked down my monument, and that&#8217;s a State Prison offense&#8211;but I
came back at &#8217;em so quick they were whipped before they knew it. They
acknowledged that the claim was mine. Well, all right, kid, let&#8217;s keep it;
you tag right along with me and back up any play that I make, and if any of
these boomers from Nevada get funny we&#8217;ll give &#8217;em the gate, the
gate!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did a little dance and Billy smiled back feebly, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>for it was all very bewildering to her.
She had expected, of course, a certain amount of lawless conduct; but that Dusty
Rhodes, an old friend of their family, should conspire to deprive her of her
claim was almost inconceivable. And that Wunpost should instantly seize him by
the throat and force him to renounce his claims was even more surprising. But of
course he had warned her, he had told her all about it, and predicted even
bolder attempts; and yet here he was, digging out the best of his ore to give to
these same Nevada burglars.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you give them all the ore for?&#8221; she asked at last.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you keep it, and we can pound out the gold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to play the game, kid,&#8221; he answered with a shrug.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the way they always do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I should think it would only make them worse. When they see
how rich it is maybe someone will try to jump us&#8211;do you think Judson Eells
will come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he&#8217;ll come,&#8221; answered Wunpost. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be
one of the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you give him a specimen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing&#8211;I&#8217;ll give him a good one. I believe
that&#8217;s a machine, up the wash.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shaded his eyes, and as they gazed up the winding canyon a monster
automobile swung around the curve. A flash and it was gone, only to rush into
view a second time and come bubbling and thundering down the wash. It drew up
before the point and four men leapt out and headed straight for the hole; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>not a word was said, but
they seemed to know by instinct just where to find the mine. Wunpost strode to
meet them and greeted them by name, they came up and looked at the ground; and
then, as another machine came around the point, they asked him his price, for
cash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing, gentlemen,&#8221; answered Wunpost. &#8220;It&#8217;s
too good to sell. It&#8217;ll pay from the first day it&#8217;s
worked.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went down to meet the second car of stampeders, and his answer to them was
the same. And each time he said it he turned to Wilhelmina, who gravely nodded
her head. It was his mine; he had found it and only given her a share of it, and
of course they must stand together; but as machine after machine came whirling
down the canyon and the bids mounted higher and higher a wistful look came into
Wilhelmina&#8217;s eye and she went down and sat with her father. It was for him
that she wanted the money that was offered her&#8211;to help him finish the road
he had been working on so long&#8211;but she did not speak, and he too sat
silent, looking on with brooding eyes. Something seemed to tell them both that
trouble was at hand, and when, after the first rush, a single auto rumbled in,
Billy rose to her feet apprehensively. A big man with red cheeks, attired in a
long linen duster, descended from the curtained machine, and she flew to the
side of Wunpost.</p>

<p>It was Judson Eells; she would know him anywhere from the description that
Wunpost had given, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span>and as he came towards the hole she took in every
detail of this man who was predestined to be her enemy. He was big and fat, with
a high George the Third nose and the florid smugness of a country squire, and as
he returned Wunpost&#8217;s greeting his pendulous lower lip was thrust up in
arrogant scorn. He came on confidently, and behind him like a shadow there
followed a mysterious second person. His nose was high and thin, his cheeks
gaunt and furrowed, and his eyes seemed brooding over some terrible wrong which
had turned him against all mankind. At first glance his face was terrifying in
its fierceness, and then the very badness of it gave the effect of a caricature.
His eyebrows were too black, his lips too grim, his jaw too firmly set; and his
haggard eyes looked like those of a woman who is about to burst into hysterical
tears. It was Pisen-face Lynch, and as Wunpost caught his eye he gave way to a
mocking smirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, good morning, Mr. Eells,&#8221; he called out cordially,
&#8220;good morning, good morning Mr. Lynch! Well, well, glad to see
you&#8211;how&#8217;s the bad man from Bodie? Meet my partner, Miss Wilhelmina
Campbell!&#8221;</p>

<p>He presented her gallantly and as Wilhelmina bowed she felt their hostile
eyes upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like to look at our mine?&#8221; rattled on Wunpost affably.
&#8220;Well, here it is, and she&#8217;s a world-beater. Take a squint at that
rock&#8211;you won&#8217;t need no glasses&#8211;how&#8217;s that, Mr. Eells,
for the pure quill?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>Eells looked at
the specimen, then looked at it again, and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, rich,&#8221; he said in a deep bass voice, &#8220;very
rich&#8211;it looks like a mine. But&#8211;er&#8211;did I understand you to say
that Miss Campbell was your partner? Because really you know&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s my partner,&#8221; replied Wunpost. &#8220;We hold
the controlling interest. Got a couple more partners that own a
third.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because really,&#8221; protested Eells, &#8220;under the terms of our
contract&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, to hell with your contract!&#8221; burst out Wunpost scornfully.
&#8220;Do you think that will hold over here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, undoubtedly!&#8221; exclaimed Eells. &#8220;I hope you
didn&#8217;t think&#8211;but no matter, I claim half of this mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t get it,&#8221; answered Wunpost. &#8220;This is over
in California. Your contract was made for Nevada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was made <i>in</i>Nevada,&#8221; corrected Judson Eells promptly,
&#8220;but it applied to all claims, <i>wherever found</i>! Would you like to
see a copy of the contract?&#8221; He turned to the automobile, and like a
jack-in-the-box a little lean man popped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; roared Wunpost, and looked about wildly, at which Cole
Campbell stepped up beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he asked, and as Wunpost shouted into
his ear Campbell shook his head and smiled dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at the contract,&#8221; he suggested, and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>Wunpost, all unstrung,
consented. Then he grabbed him back and yelled into his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> no good now&#8211;he&#8217;s used it once
already!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; queried Campbell, still reaching for the
contract; and the jack-in-the-box thrust it into his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he used that same paper to claim the Wunpost&#8211;he can&#8217;t
claim every mine I find!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; returned Campbell, putting on his
glasses, and Wunpost flew into a fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git out of here!&#8221; he yelled, making a kick at Pisen-face Lynch;
&#8220;git out, or I&#8217;ll be the death of ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Pisen-face Lynch recoiled like a rattlesnake and stood set with a gun in
each hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it,&#8221; he rasped, and Wunpost turned away
from him with a groan of mortal agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it say?&#8221; he demanded of Campbell. &#8220;Can he claim
this mine, too? But say, listen; I wasn&#8217;t <i>working</i> for him! I was
working for myself, and furnishing my own grub&#8211;and I&#8217;ve never been
through here before! He can&#8217;t claim I found it when I was under his
grubstake, because I&#8217;ve never been into this country!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, all a-tremble, and looked on helplessly while Cole Campbell read
on through the &#8220;fine print&#8221;; and, not being able to read the words,
he watched the face of the deaf man like a criminal who hopes for a reprieve.
But there was no reprieve for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_60'></a>60</span>Wunpost, for the paper he had signed made provision
against every possible contingency; and the man who had drawn it stood there
smiling triumphantly&#8211;the jack-in-the-box was none other than Lapham.
Wunpost watched till he saw his last hope flicker out, then whirled on the
gloating lawyer. Phillip F. Lapham was tall and thin, with the bloodless pallor
of a lunger, but as Wunpost began to curse him a red spot mounted to each
cheek-bone and he pointed his lanky forefinger like a weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you threaten me!&#8221; he cried out vindictively,
&#8220;or I&#8217;ll have you put under bond. The fault is your own if you
failed to read this contract, or failed to understand its intent. But there it
stands, a paper of record and unbeatable in any court in the land. I challenge
you to break it&#8211;every provision is reciprocal&#8211;it is sound both in
law and equity! And under clause seven my client, Mr. Eells, is entitled to
one-half of this claim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I only own one-third of it!&#8221; protested Wunpost desperately.
&#8220;I located it for myself and Wilhelmina Campbell, and then we gave Dusty
Rhodes a third.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s beside the point,&#8221; answered Lapham briefly.
&#8220;If you were the original and sole discoverer, Mr. Eells is entitled to
one-half, and any agreements which you have made with others will have to be
modified accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; yelled a voice, and Dusty Rhodes, who had
been listening, now jumped into the center of the arena. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
you to understand,&#8221; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_61'></a>61</span>he cried in a fury, &#8220;that I&#8217;m entitled to
a full half in this claim. I was with this man Wunpost when he made the
discovery, and according to mining law I&#8217;m entitled to one-half of
it&#8211;I don&#8217;t give <i>that</i> for you and your contract!&#8221;</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers under the lawyer&#8217;s nose and Lapham drew back,
startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then in that case,&#8221; stated Wunpost, &#8220;I don&#8217;t get
<i>anything</i>&#8211;and I&#8217;m the man that discovered it! But I&#8217;ll
tell you, my merry men, there&#8217;s another law yet, when a man is sure
he&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tapped his six-shooter and even Lynch blenched, for the fighting light had
come into his eyes. &#8220;No,&#8221; went on Wunpost, &#8220;you can&#8217;t
work that on me. I found this mine and I&#8217;m going to have half of it or
shoot it out with the bunch of ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have my share,&#8221; interposed Wilhelmina tremulously, and
he flinched as if struck by a whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;It&#8217;s these
high-binders I&#8217;m after. You, Dusty, you don&#8217;t get anything now. If
this big fat slob is going to claim half my mine, you can
<i>law</i> us&#8211;he&#8217;ll have to pay the bills. Now git, you old dastard,
and if you horn in here again I&#8217;ll show you where you head
<i>out</i>!&#8221; He waved him away, and Dusty Rhodes slunk off, for a guilty
conscience makes cowards of us all; but Judson Eells stood solid as adamant,
though his lawyer was whispering in his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and see him,&#8221; nodded Eells, and as Lapham followed Rhodes he
turned to the excited Wunpost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Calhoun,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I see no reason to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>withdraw from my position
in regard to this claim. This contract is legal and was made in good faith, and
moreover I can prove that I paid out two thousand dollars before you ever
located a claim. But all that can be settled in court. If you have given Miss
Campbell a third, her share is now a sixth, because only half of the mine was
yours to give; and so on with the rest, though if Mr. Rhodes&#8217; claim is
valid we will allow him his original one-third. Now what would you say if I
should allow <i>you</i> one-third, of which you can give Miss Campbell what you
wish, and I will keep the other, allowing Mr. Rhodes the last&#8211;each one of
us to hold a third interest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say&#x2500;&#8221; burst out Wunpost, and then he stopped, for
Wilhelmina was tugging at his arm. She spoke quickly into his ear, he flared up
and then subsided, and at last he turned sulkily to Eells.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the third. I see
you&#8217;ve got me cinched.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MORE DREAMS</span></h2>

<p>In four days time Wunpost had seen his interest dwindle from full ownership
to a mere sixth of the Willie Meena. First he had given Billy half, then they
had each given Rhodes a sixth; and now Judson Eells had stepped in with his
contract and trimmed their holdings by a half. In another day or so, if the
ratio kept up, Wunpost&#8217;s sixth would be reduced to a twelfth, a
twenty-fourth, a forty-eighth, a ninety-sixth&#8211;and he had discovered the
mine himself! What philosophy or sophistry can reconcile a man to such buffets
from the hand of Fate? Wunpost cursed and turned to raw whiskey. It was the
infamy of it all; the humiliation, the disgrace, the insult of being trimmed by
a lawyer&#8211;twice! Yes, twice in the same place, with the same contract, the
same system; and now this same Flip Flappum was busy as a hunting dog trying to
hire one of his partners to sell him out!</p>

<p>Wunpost towered above Old Whiskers, and so terrible was his presence that the
saloon-keeper never hinted at pay. He poured out drink after drink of the
vitriolic whiskey, which Whiskers made in the secrecy of his back-room; and as
Wunpost drank <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>and
shuddered the waspish Phillip F. Lapham set about his complete undoing. First he
went to Dusty Rhodes, who still claimed a full half, and browbeat him until he
fell back to a third; and then, when Dusty priced his third at one million, he
turned to the disillusioned Billy. Her ideas were more moderate, as far as
values were concerned, but her loyalty to Wunpost was still unshaken and she
refused to even consider a sale. Back and forth went the lawyer like a shuttle
in its socket, from Dusty Rhodes to Wilhelmina and then back once more to
Rhodes; but Dusty would sign nothing, sell nothing, agree to nothing, and Billy
was almost as bad. She placed a cash value of twenty thousand dollars on her
interest in the Willie Meena Mine, but the sale was contingent upon the consent
of John C. Calhoun, who had drowned his sorrows at last. So they waited until
morning and Billy laid the matter before him when her father brought the drunken
man to their tent.</p>

<p>Wunpost was more than drunk, he was drugged and robbed of reason by the
poison which Old Whiskers had brewed; but even with this handicap his mind leapt
straight to the point and he replied with an emphatic &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty thousand!&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;twenty thousand
devils&#8211;twenty thousand little demons from hell! What do you want to sell
me out for&#8211;didn&#8217;t I give you your interest? Well, listen,
kid&#8211;you ever been to school? Then how much is one-sixth and
one-third&#8211;add &#8217;em together! Makes <i>three</i>-sixths, don&#8217;t
it&#8211;well, ain&#8217;t that a half? I ain&#8217;t educated, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>that&#8217;s all right; but
I can <i>think</i>, kid, can&#8217;t I? Flip Flappum he wants to get control.
Give him a half, under my contract, and he can take possession&#8211;and then
where do <i>I</i> git off? I git off at the same place I got off over at
Wunpost; he&#8217;s trying to freeze me out. So if you want to do me dirt, kid,
when I&#8217;ve always been your friend, go to it and sell him your share. Take
your paltry twenty thousand and let old Wunpost rustle&#8211;serves him right,
the poor, ignorant fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>He swayed about and Billy drew away from him, but her answer to Lapham was
final. She would not sell out, at any price, without the consent of Wunpost.
Lapham nodded and darted off&#8211;he was a man who dealt with facts and not
with the moonshine of sentiment&#8211;and this time he fairly flew at Dusty
Rhodes. He took him off to one side, where no one could listen in, and at the
end of half an hour Mr. Rhodes had signed a paper giving a quit-claim to his
interest in the mine. Old Whiskers was summoned from his attendance on the
bottles, the lawyer presented his case; and, whatever the arguments, they
prevailed also with the saloon-keeper, who signed up and took his check.
Presumably they had to do with threats of expensive litigation and appeals to
the higher courts, with a learned exposition of the weakness of their case and
the air-tight position of Judson Eells; the point is, they prevailed, and Eells
took possession of the mine, placing Pisen-face Lynch in charge.</p>

<p>Old Whiskers folded his tent and returned to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_66'></a>66</span>Blackwater, where many of the stampeders had preceded
him; and Dusty Rhodes, with a guilty grin, folded his check and started for the
railroad. Cole Campbell and his daughter, when they heard the news and found
themselves debarred from the property, packed up and took the trail home, and
when John C. Calhoun came out of his coma he was left without a friend in the
world. The rush had passed on, across the Sink to Blackwater and to the gulches
in the mountains beyond; for the men from Nevada had not been slow to comprehend
that the Willie Meena held no promise for them.</p>

<p>It was a single rich blow-out in a country otherwise barren; and the tales of
the pocket miners, who held claims back of Blackwater, had led to a second
stampede. The Willie Meena was a prophecy of what might be expected if a similar
formation could be found, but it was no more than the throat of an extinct
volcano, filled up with gold-bearing quartz. There was no fissure-vein, no great
mother lode leading off through the country for miles; only a hogback of black
quartz and then worlds and worlds of desert as barren as wash boulders could
make it. So they rose and went on, like birds in full flight after they have
settled for a moment on the plain, and when Wunpost rose up and rubbed his eyes
his great camp had passed away like a dream.</p>

<p>Two days later he walked wearily across the desert from Blackwater, with a
two gallon canteen under his arm, and at the entrance to Jail Canyon he paused
and looked in doubtfully before he shambled <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_67'></a>67</span>up to the house. He was broke, and he knew it, and
added to that shame was the greater shame that comes from drink. Old
Whiskers&#8217; poisonous whiskey had sapped his self-respect, and yet he came
on boldly. There was a fever in his eye like that of the gambler who has lost
all, yet still watches the fall of the cards; and as Wilhelmina came out he
winked at her mysteriously and beckoned her away from the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something good,&#8221; he told her confidentially;
&#8220;can you get off to go down to Blackwater?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I might,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Father&#8217;s working up the
canyon. Is it something about the mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Say, what d&#8217;ye think of Dusty?
He sold us out for five thousand dollars! Five thousand&#8211;that&#8217;s
all&#8211;and Old Whiskers took the same, giving Judson Eells full control. They
cleaned us, Billy, but we&#8217;ll get our cut yet&#8211;do you know what
they&#8217;re trying to do? Eells is going to organize a company and sell a few
shares in order to finance the mine; and if we want to, kid, we can turn in our
third interest and get the pro rata in stock. We might as well do it, because
they&#8217;ve got the control and otherwise we won&#8217;t get anything.
They&#8217;ve barred us off the property and we&#8217;ll never get a cent if it
produces a million dollars. But look, here&#8217;s the idea&#8211;Judson Eells
is badly bent on account of what he lost at Wunpost, and he&#8217;s crazy to
organize a company and market the treasury stock. We&#8217;ll go in with him,
see, and as soon as we get our stock we&#8217;ll peddle it for what we can get.
That&#8217;ll <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>net us
a few thousand and you can take your share and help the old man build his
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stubborn look on Billy&#8217;s face suddenly gave place to one of doubt
and then to one of swift decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need to see
Father&#8211;just tell them that I&#8217;ve agreed. And when the time comes,
send an Indian up to notify me and I&#8217;ll ride down and sign the
papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost with a hint of his old smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come up and tell you myself. Have you heard the news from
below? Well, every house in Blackwater is plumb full of boomers&#8211;and them
pocket-miners are all selling out. The whole country&#8217;s staked, clean back
to the peaks, and old Eells says he&#8217;s going to start a bank. There&#8217;s
three new saloons, a couple more restaurants, and she sure looks like a good
live camp&#8211;and me, the man that started it and made the whole country, I
can&#8217;t even bum a drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; returned Billy, and regarded him so
intently that he hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wait!&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show &#8217;em
who&#8217;s who! I ain&#8217;t down, by no manner of means. I&#8217;ve got a
mine or two hid out that would make &#8217;em fairly scream if I&#8217;d show
&#8217;em a piece of the rock. All I need is a little capital, just a few
thousand dollars to get me a good outfit of mules, and I&#8217;ll come back into
Blackwater with a pack-load of ore that&#8217;ll make &#8217;em <i>all</i> sit up
and take notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung his fist into his hand with oratorical <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>fervor and Mrs. Campbell appeared suddenly
at the door. Her first favorable impression of the gallant young Southerner had
been changed by the course of events and she was now morally certain that the
envious Dusty Rhodes had come nearer the unvarnished truth. To be sure he had
apologized, but Wunpost himself had said that it was only to gain a share in the
mine&#8211;and how lamentably had Wunpost failed, after all his windy boasts,
when it came to a conflict with Judson Eells. He had weakened like a schoolboy,
all his arguments had been puerile; and even her husband, who was far from
censorious, had stated that the whole affair was badly handled. And now here he
was, after a secret conference with her daughter, suddenly bursting into
vehement protestations and hinting at still other hidden mines. Well, his mines
might be as rich as he declared them to be, but Mrs. Campbell herself was
dubious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilhelmina,&#8221; she called, &#8220;don&#8217;t stand out in the
sun! Why don&#8217;t you invite Mr. Calhoun to the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hint was sufficient, Mr. Calhoun excused himself hastily and went
striding away down the canyon; and Wilhelmina, after a perfunctory return to the
house, slipped out and ran up to her lookout. Not a word that he had said about
the rush to Blackwater was in any way startling to her; she had seen every
dust-cloud, marked each automobile as it rushed past, and even noted the
stampede from the west. For the natural way to Blackwater was not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>across Death Valley from
the distant Nevada camps, but from the railroad which lay only forty miles to
the west and was reached by an automobile stage. The road came down through
Sheep-herder Canyon, on the other side of the Sink, and every day as she looked
across its vastness she saw the long trailers of dust. She knew that the autos
were rushing in with men and the slow freighters were hauling in
supplies&#8211;all the real news for her was the number of saloons and
restaurants, and that Eells was starting a bank.</p>

<p>A bank! And in Blackwater! The only bank that Blackwater had ever had or
needed was the safe in Old Whiskers&#8217; saloon; and now this rich schemer,
this iron-handed robber, was going to start a bank! Billy lay inside the portal
of her gate of dreams and watched Wunpost as he plodded across the plain, and
she resolved to join with him and do her level best to bring Eells&#8217; plans
to naught. If he was counting on the sale of his treasury stock to fill up the
vaults of his bank he would find others in the market with stock in both hands,
peddling it out to the highest bidder. And even if the mine was worth into the
millions, she, for one, would sell every share. It was best, after all, since
Eells owned the control, to sell out for what they could get; and if this was
merely a deep-laid scheme to buy in their stock for almost nothing they would at
least have a little ready cash.</p>

<p>The Campbells were poor; her father even lacked the money to buy powder to
blast out his road, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_71'></a>71</span>so he struggled on, grading up the easy places and
leaving Corkscrew Gorge untouched. That would call for heavy blasting and crews
of hardy men to climb up and shoot down the walls, and even after that the
jagged rock-bed must be covered and leveled to the semblance of a road. Now
nothing but a trail led up through the dark passageway, where grinding boulders
had polished the walls like glass; and until that gateway was opened Cole
Campbell&#8217;s road was useless; it might as well be all trail. But with five
thousand dollars, or even less&#8211;with whatever she received from her
stock&#8211;the gateway could be conquered, her father&#8217;s dream would come
true and all their life would be changed.</p>

<p>There would be a road, right past their house, where great trucks would
lumber forth loaded down with ore from their mine, and return ladened with
machinery from the railroad. There would be miners going by and stopping for a
drink, and someone to talk to every day, and the loneliness which oppressed her
like a physical pain would give place to gaiety and peace. Her father would be
happy and stop working so hard, and her mother would not have to worry&#8211;all
if she, Wilhelmina, could just sell her stock and salvage a pittance from the
wreck.</p>

<p>She knew now what Wunpost had meant when he had described the outside world
and the men they would meet at the rush, yet for all his hard-won knowledge he
had gone down once more before Judson Eells and his gang. But he had spoken true
when he said they would resort to murder to gain possession <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>of their mine, and though he had yielded
at last to the lure of strong drink, in her heart she could not blame him too
much. It was not by wrongdoing that he had wrecked their high hopes, but by
signing a contract long years before without reading what he called the fine
print. He was just a boy, after all, in spite of his boasting and his vaunted
knowledge of the world; and now in his trouble he had come back to her, to the
one person he knew he could trust. She gazed a long time at the dwindling form
till it was lost in the immensity of the plain; and then she gazed on, for
dreams were all she had to comfort her lonely heart</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BABES IN THE WOODS</span></h2>

<p>Ever since David went forth and slew Goliath with his sling, youth has set
its puny lance to strike down giants; and history, making much of the hotspurs
who won, draws a veil over the striplings who were slain. And yet all who know
the stern conditions of life must recognize that youth is a handicap, and if
David had but donned the heavy armor of King Saul he too would have gone to his
death. But instead he stepped forth untrammeled by its weight, with nothing but
a stone and a sling, and because the scoffing giant refused to raise his shield
he was struck down by the pebble of a child. But giant Judson Eells was in a
baby-killing mood when he invited Wunpost and Wilhelmina to his den; and when
they emerged, after signing articles of incorporation, he licked his chops and
smiled.</p>

<p>It developed at the meeting that the sole function of a stockholder is to
vote for the Directors of the Company; and, having elected Eells and Lapham and
John C. Calhoun Directors, the stockholders&#8217; meeting adjourned.
Reconvening immediately as a, Board of Directors, Judson Eells was elected
President, John C. Calhoun, Vice-President and Phillip F. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>Lapham Secretary-treasurer&#8211;after
which an assessment of ten cents a share was levied upon all the stock. Exit
John C. Calhoun and Wilhelmina Campbell, stripped of their stock and all faith
in mankind. For even if by some miracle they should raise the necessary sum
Judson Eells and Phillip Lapham would immediately vote a second assessment, and
so on, <i>ad finitum</i>. Holding a majority of the stock, Eells could control
the Board of Directors, and through it the policies of the company; and any
assessments which he himself might pay would but be transferred from one pocket
to the other. It was as neat a job of baby-killing as Eells had ever
accomplished, and he slew them both with a smile.</p>

<p>They had conspired in their innocence to gain stock in the company and to
hawk it about the streets; but neither had thought to suggest the customary
Article: &#8220;The stock of said company shall be non-assessable.&#8221; The
Articles of Incorporation had been drawn up by Phillip F. Lapham; and yet, after
all his hard experiences, Wunpost was so awed by the legal procedure that he
forgot all about the fine print. Not that it made any difference, they would
have trimmed him anyway, but it was three times in the very same place! He
cursed himself out loud for an ignorant baboon and left Wilhelmina in tears.</p>

<p>She had come down with her mother, her father being busy, and they had
planned to take in the town; but after this final misfortune Wilhelmina lost all
interest in the busy marts of trade. What to her <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>were clothes and shoes when she had no
money to buy them&#8211;and when overdressed women, none too chaste in their
demeanor, stared after her in boorish amusement? Blackwater had become a great
city, but it was not for her&#8211;the empty honor of having the Willie Meena
named after her was all she had won from her mine. John C. Calhoun had been
right when he warned her, long before, that the mining game was more like a dog
fight than it was like a Sunday school picnic; and yet&#8211;well, some people
made money at it. Perhaps they were better at reading the fine print, and not so
precipitate about signing Articles of Incorporation, but as far as she was
concerned Wilhelmina made a vow never to trust a lawyer again.</p>

<p>She returned to the ranch, where the neglected garden soon showed signs of
her changing mood; but after the weeds had been chopped out and routed she
slipped back to her lookout on the hill. It was easier to tear the weeds from a
tangled garden than old memories from her lonely heart; and she took up, against
her will, the old watch for Wunpost, who had departed from Blackwater in a fury.
He had stood on the corner and, oblivious of her presence, had poured out the
vials of his wrath; he had cursed Eells for a swindler, and Lapham for his dog
and Lynch for his yellow hound. He had challenged them all, either individually
or collectively, to come forth and meet him in battle; and then he had offered
to fight any man in Blackwater who would say a good word for any of them. But
Blackwater <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>looked on
in cynical amusement, for Eells was the making of the town; and when he had
given off the worst of his venom Wunpost had tied up his roll and departed.</p>

<p>He had left as he had come, a single-blanket tourist, packing his worldly
possessions on his back; and when last seen by Wilhelmina he was headed east, up
the wash that came down from the Panamints. Where he was going, when he would
return, if he ever would return, all were mysteries to the girl who waited on;
and if she watched for him it was because there was no one else whose coming
would stir her heart. Far up the canyon and over the divide there lived Hungry
Bill and his family, but Hungry was an Indian and when he dropped in it was
always to get something to eat. He had two sons and two daughters, whom he kept
enslaved, forbidding them to even think of marriage; and all his thoughts were
of money and things to eat, for Hungry Bill was an Indian miser.</p>

<p>He came through often now with his burros packed with fruit from the
abandoned white-man&#8217;s ranch that he had occupied; and even his wild-eyed
daughters had more variety than Billy, for they accompanied him to Blackwater
and Willie Meena. There they sold their grapes and peaches at exorbitant prices
and came back with coffee and flour, but neither would say a word for fear of
their old father, who watched them with intolerant eyes. They were evil, snaky
eyes, for it was said that in his day he had waylaid many a venturesome
prospector, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>and while
they gleamed ingratiatingly when he was presented with food, at no time did they
show good will. He was still a renegade at heart, shunned and avoided by his own
kinsmen, the Shoshones who camped around Wild Rose; but it was from him, from
this old tyrant that she despised so cordially, that Wilhelmina received her
first news of Wunpost.</p>

<p>Hungry Bill came up grinning, on his way down from his ranch, and fixed her
with his glittering black eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You savvy Wunpo?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;hi-ko man&#8211;busca
gol&#8217;? Him sendum piece of lock!&#8221;</p>

<p>He produced a piece of rock from a knot in his shirt-tail and handed it over
to her slowly. It was a small chunk of polished quartz, half green, half
turquoise blue; and in the center, like a jewel, a crystal of yellow gold
gleamed out from its matrix of blue. Wilhelmina gazed at it blankly, then
flushed and turned away as she felt Hungry Bill&#8217;s eyes upon her. He was a
disreputable old wretch, who imputed to others the base motives which governed
his own acts; and when she read his black heart Wilhelmina straightened up and
gave him back the stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you keepum!&#8221; protested Hungry. &#8220;Hi-ko ketchum plenty
mo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Wilhelmina shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you give that to my mother. Are those your
girls down there? Well, why don&#8217;t you let them come up to the house? You
no good&#8211;I don&#8217;t like bad Indians!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>She turned away
from him, still frowning angrily, and strode on down to the creek; but the
daughters of Hungry Bill, in their groveling way, seemed to share the low ideals
of their father. They were tall and sturdy girls, clad in breezy calico dresses
and with their hair down over their eyes; and as they gazed out from beneath
their bangs a guilty smile contorted their lips, a smile that made Wilhelmina
writhe.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; she snapped, and as the
scared look came back she turned on her heel and left them. What could one
expect, of course, from Hungry Bill&#8217;s daughters after they had been
guarded like the slave-girls in a harem; but the joy of hearing from Wunpost was
quite lost in the fierce anger which the conduct of his messengers evoked. He
was up there, somewhere, and he had made another strike&#8211;the most beautiful
blue quartz in the world&#8211;but these renegade Shoshones with their
understanding smiles had quite killed the pleasure of it for her. She returned
to the house where Hungry Bill, in the kitchen, was wolfing down a great pan of
beans; but the sight of the old glutton with his mouth down to the plate quite
sickened her and drove her away. Wunpost was up in the hills, and he had made a
strike, but with that she must remain content until he either came down himself
or chose a more highminded messenger.</p>

<p>Hungry Bill went on to Blackwater and came back with a load of supplies,
which he claimed he was taking to &#8220;Wunpo&#8221;; and, after he had passed
up the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>canyon,
Wilhelmina strolled along behind him. At the mouth of Corkscrew Gorge there was
a great pool of water, overshadowed by a rank growth of willows through whose
tops the wild grapevines ran riot. Here it had been her custom, during the heat
of the day, to paddle along the shallows or sit and enjoy the cool air. There
was always a breeze at the mouth of Corkscrew Gorge, and when it drew down, as
it did on this day, it carried the odors of dank caverns. In the dark and gloomy
depths of this gash through the hills the rocks were always damp and cold; and
beneath the great waterfalls, where the cloudbursts had scooped out pot-holes,
there was a delicious mist and spray. She dawdled by the willows, then splashed
on up the slippery trail until, above the last echoing waterfall, she stepped
out into the world beyond.</p>

<p>The great canyon spread out again, once she had passed the waterworn Gorge,
and peak after peak rose up to right and left where yawning side canyons led in.
But all were set on edge and reared up to dizzying heights; and along their
scarred flanks there lay huge slides of shaley rock, ready to slip at the touch
of a hand. Vivid stripes of red and green, alternating with layers of blue and
white, painted the sides of the striated ridges; and odd seams here and there
showed dull yellows and chocolate browns like the edge of a crumbled layer-cake.
Up the canyon the walls shut in again, and then they opened out, and so on for
nine miles until Old Panamint was reached and the open valley sloped up to the
summit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>Many a time in the
old days when they had lived in Panamint had Wilhelmina scaled those far
heights; the huge white wall of granite dotted with ball-like piñons and
junipers, which fenced them from Death Valley beyond. It opened up like a gulf,
once the summit was reached, and below the jagged precipices stretched long
ridges and fan-like washes which lost themselves at last in the Sink. For a
hundred miles to the north and the south it lay, a writhing ribbon of white,
pinching down to narrow strips, then broadening out in gleaming marshes; and on
both sides the mountains rose up black and forbidding, a bulwark against the
sky. Wilhelmina had never entered it, she had been content to look down; and
then she crept back to beautiful sheltered Panamint where father had his
mine.</p>

<p>It was up on the ridge, where the white granite of the summit came into
contact with the burnt limestone and schist; and, of all the rich mines, the
Homestake was the best, until the cloudburst came along and spoiled all of them.
Wilhelmina still remembered how the great flood had passed the town, moving
boulders as if they were pebbles; but not until it reached the place where she
stood had it done irretrievable damage. The roadbed was washed out, but the
streambed remained, and the banks from which to fill in more dirt; but when the
flood struck the Gorge it backed up into a lake, for the narrow defile was
choked. Trees and rocks and rumbling boulders had piled up against its entrance,
holding the waters back like a dam; and when they broke <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>through they sluiced everything before
them, gouging the canyon down to the bedrock. Now twelve years had passed by and
only a hazardous trail threaded the Gorge which had once been a highway.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina gazed up the valley and sighed again, for since that terrific
cloudburst she had been stranded in Jail Canyon like a piece of driftwood tossed
up by the flood. Nothing happened to her, any more than to the piñon logs which
the waters had wedged high above the stream, and as she returned home down the
Gorge she almost wished for another flood, to float them and herself away. No
one came by there any more, the trail was so poor, and yet her father still
clung to the mine; but a flood would either fill up the Gorge with débris or
make even him give up hope. She sank down by the cool pool and put her feet in
the water, dabbling them about like a wilful child; but at a shout from below
she rose up a grown woman, for she knew it was Dusty Rhodes.</p>

<p>He came on up the creekbed with his burros on the trot, hurling clubs at the
laggards as he ran; and when they stopped short at the sight of Wilhelmina he
almost rushed them over her. But a burro is a creature of lively imagination, to
whom the unknown is always terrible; and at a fresh outburst from Dusty the
whole outfit took to the brush, leaving him face to face with his erstwhile
partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hello, hello!&#8221; he called out gruffly. &#8220;Say, did Hungry
Bill go through here? He was jest down to Blackwater, buying some grub at the
store, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>and he paid
for it with rock that was <i>half gold</i>! So git out of the road, my little
girl&#8211;I&#8217;m going up to prospect them hills!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call me your little girl!&#8221; called back Billy
angrily. &#8220;And Hungry Bill hasn&#8217;t got any mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he ain&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; mocked Dusty, leaving his burros to
browse while he strode triumphantly up to her. &#8220;Then jest look at
<i>that</i>, my&#8211;my fine young lady! I got it from the store-keeper
myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed her a piece of green and blue quartz, but she only glanced at it
languidly. The memory of his perfidy on a previous occasion made her long to
puncture his pride, and she passed the gold ore back to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen that before,&#8221; she said with a sniff, &#8220;so
you can stop driving those burros so hard. It came from Wunpost&#8217;s
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wunpost!&#8221; yelled Dusty Rhodes, his eyes getting big; and then he
spat out an oath. &#8220;Who told ye?&#8221; he demanded, sticking his face into
hers, and she stepped away disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry Bill,&#8221; she said, and watched him writhe as the bitter
truth went home. &#8220;You think you&#8217;re so smart,&#8221; she taunted at
last, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you go out and find one for yourself? I suppose you
want to rush in and claim a half interest in his strike and then sell out to old
Eells. I hope he kills you, if you try to do it&#8211;<i>I</i> would, if I were
him. What&#8217;d you do with that five thousand dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;Eh&#8211;eh&#8211;that&#8217;s none of your
business,&#8221; bleated Dusty Rhodes, whose trip to Los Angeles had proved
disastrous. &#8220;And if Wunpost gave Hungry that sack of ore he stole it from
some other feller&#8217;s mine. I knowed all along he&#8217;d locate that Black
P&#8217;int if I ever let him stop&#8211;I&#8217;ve had my eye on it for
years&#8211;and that&#8217;s why I hurried by. I discovered it myself, only I
never told nobody&#8211;he must have heard me talking in my sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, or when you were drunk!&#8221; suggested Wilhelmina maliciously.
&#8220;I hear you got robbed in Los Angeles. And anyhow I&#8217;m glad, because
you stole that five thousand dollars, and no good ever came from stolen
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it didn&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; sneered Dusty, who was recovering his
poise, &#8220;well, I&#8217;ll bet ye <i>this</i> rock was stolen! And if
that&#8217;s the case, where does your young man git off, that you think the
world and all of? But you&#8217;ve got to show me that he ever <i>saw</i> this
rock&#8211;I believe old Hungry was lying to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let me keep you!&#8221; cried Billy, bowing
mockingly. &#8220;Go on over and ask him yourself&#8211;but I&#8217;ll bet you
don&#8217;t <i>dare</i> to meet Wunpost!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How come Hungry to tell you?&#8221; burst out Dusty Rhodes at last,
and Wilhelmina smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s none of your business, my busy little man,&#8221; she
mimicked in patronizing tones, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got a piece of that rock
right up at the house. You go back there and mother will show it to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going on!&#8221; answered Dusty with instant <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>decision;
&#8220;can&#8217;t stop to make no visit today. They&#8217;s a big rush
coming&#8211;every burro-man in Blackwater&#8211;and some of them are legging it
afoot. But that thieving son of a goat, <i>he</i> never found no mine! I know
it&#8211;it can&#8217;t be possible!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW DEAL</span></h2>

<p>The rush of burro-men to Hungry Bill&#8217;s ranch followed close in Dusty
Rhodes&#8217; wake, and some there were who came on foot; but they soon came
stringing back, for it was a fine, large country and Hungry Bill was about as
communicative as a rattlesnake. All he knew, or cared to know, was the price of
corn and fruit, which he sold at Blackwater prices; and the search for Wunpost
had only served to show to what lengths a man will go for revenge. In some
mysterious way Wunpost had acquired a horse and mule, both sharp-shod for
climbing over rocks, and he had dallied at Hungry Bill&#8217;s until the first
of the stampeders had come in sight on the Panamint trail. Then he had set out
up the ridge, riding the horse and packing the mule, and even an Indian trailer
had given out and quit without ever bringing them in sight of him again. He had
led them such a chase that the hardiest came back satisfied, and they agreed
that he could keep his old mine.</p>

<p>The excitement died away or was diverted to other channels, for Blackwater
was having a boom; and, just as Wilhelmina had given up hope of seeing <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>him, John C. Calhoun came
riding down the ridge. Not down the canyon, where the trail made riding easy,
but down the steep ridge trail, where a band of mountain sheep was accustomed to
come for water. Wilhelmina was in her tunnel, looking down with envious eyes at
the traffic in the valley below; and he came upon her suddenly, so suddenly it
made her jump, for no one ever rode up there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he hailed, spurring his horse up to the portal and
letting out his rope as he entered. &#8220;Kinder hot, out there in the sun.
Well, how&#8217;s tricks?&#8221; he inquired, sitting down in the shade and
wiping the streaming sweat from his eyes. &#8220;Hungry Bill says you s-spurned
my gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you tell that old Indian?&#8221; burst out Wilhelmina
wrathfully, and Wunpost looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;only to get me some grub and give
you that piece of polished rock. How was that for the real old high grade? From
my new mine, up in the high country. What&#8217;s the matter&#8211;did Hungry
get gay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;not that,&#8221; hesitated Wilhelmina, &#8220;but he looked
at me so funny that I told him to give it to Mother. What was it you told him
about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; protested Wunpost, &#8220;just to give you the
rock. Oh, I know!&#8221; He laughed and slapped his leg. &#8220;He&#8217;s
scared some prospector will steal one of them gals, and I told him not to worry
about me. Guess that gave him a tip, because he looked wise as a prairie dog
when I told him to give <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_87'></a>87</span>that specimen to you.&#8221; He paused and knocked the
dust out of his battered old hat, then glanced up from under his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t mad, are you?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;because if you are
I&#8217;m on my way&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she answered quickly. &#8220;Where have you been all
the time? Dusty Rhodes came through here, looking for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they all came,&#8221; he grinned, &#8220;but I showed &#8217;em
some sheep-trails before they got tired of chasing me. I knew for a certainty
that those mugs would follow Hungry&#8211;they did the same thing over in
Nevada. I sent in an Indian to buy me a little grub and they trailed me clean
across Death Valley. Guess that ore must have looked pretty good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get it?&#8221; she asked, and he rolled his eyes
roguishly while a crafty smile lit up his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I&#8217;d tell you,
you&#8217;d have the answer. But I&#8217;m not going to show it to
<i>nobody</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need to think that <i>I</i> care!&#8221; she
spoke up resentfully, &#8220;nobody asked you to show them your gold. And after
what happened with the Willie Meena I wouldn&#8217;t take your old mine for a
gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve quit
taking in pardners&#8211;it&#8217;s a lone hand for me, after this. I&#8217;m
sure slow in the head, but I reckon I&#8217;ve learned my lesson&#8211;never go
up against the other man&#8217;s game. Old Eells is a lawyer and I tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>beat him at law.
We&#8217;ve switched the deal now and he can play <i>my</i> game a
while&#8211;hide-and-seek, up in them high peaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand in the direction of the Panamints and winked at her
exultantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at <i>that</i>!&#8221; he said, and drew a rock from his shirt
pocket which was caked and studded with gold. It was more like a chunk of gold
with a little quartz attached to it, and as she exclaimed he leaned back and
gloated. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got worlds of it!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Let
&#8217;em get out and rustle for it&#8211;that&#8217;s the way I made my start.
By the time they&#8217;ve rode as far as I have they&#8217;ll know she&#8217;s a
mountain sheep country. I located two mines right smack beside the trail and
these jaspers came along and stole them both. All right! Fine! Fine! Let
&#8217;em look for the old Sockdolager where I got this gold, and the first man
that finds it can have it! I&#8217;m a sport&#8211;I haven&#8217;t even staked
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can <i>I</i> have it?&#8221; asked Billy, her eyes beginning to
glow, &#8220;because, oh, we need money so bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, kid?&#8221; inquired Wunpost with a fatherly smile.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you got a good home, and everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the road&#8211;Father&#8217;s road. If I just had the money
we&#8217;d start right in on it tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo! I&#8217;ll build you the road!&#8221; declared Wunpost
munificently. &#8220;And it won&#8217;t cost either one of us a cent.
Don&#8217;t believe it, eh? You think this is bunk? Then I&#8217;ll tell you,
kid, what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_89'></a>89</span>make you a bet we&#8217;ll have a wagon-road up that
canyon before three months are up. And all by head-work, mind ye&#8211;not a
dollar of our own money&#8211;might even get old Eells to build it. Yes,
I&#8217;m serious; I&#8217;ve got a new system&#8211;been thinking it out, up in
the hills&#8211;and just to show you how brainy I am I&#8217;ll make this
demonstration for nothing. You don&#8217;t need to bet me anything, just
acknowledge that I&#8217;m the king when it comes to the real inside work; and
before I get through I&#8217;ll have Judson Eells belly up and gasping for air
like a fish. I&#8217;m going to trim him, the big fat slob; I&#8217;m going to
give him a lesson that&#8217;ll learn him to lay off of me for life; I&#8217;m
going to make him so scared he&#8217;ll step down into the gutter when he meets
me coming down the sidewalk. Well, laugh, doggone it, but you watch my
dust&#8211;I&#8217;m going to hang his hide on the fence!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you told me before,&#8221; she reminded him
mischievously, &#8220;but somehow it didn&#8217;t work out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll work out this time,&#8221; he retorted grimly. &#8220;A
man has got to learn. I&#8217;m just a kid, I know that, and I&#8217;m not much
on book learning, but don&#8217;t you never say I can&#8217;t <i>think</i>!
Maybe I can&#8217;t beat them crooks when I play their own game, but this time
<i>I deal the hand</i>! Do you git me? We&#8217;ve switched the deal! And if I
don&#8217;t ring in a cold deck and deal from the bottom it won&#8217;t be
because it&#8217;s <i>wrong</i>. I&#8217;m out to scalp &#8217;em, see, and just
to convince you we&#8217;ll begin by building that road. Your old man is <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>wrong, he don&#8217;t need
no road and it won&#8217;t do him any good when he gets it; but just to make you
happy and show you how much I think of you, I&#8217;ll do it&#8211;only
you&#8217;ve got to stand pat! No Sunday school stuff, see? We&#8217;re going to
fight this out with hay hooks, and when I come back with his hair don&#8217;t
blame me if old Eells makes a roar. I&#8217;m going to stick him, see; and
I&#8217;m not going to stick him once&#8211;I&#8217;m going to stick him three
times, till he squeals like a pig, because that&#8217;s what he did to me! He
cleaned me once on the Wunpost, and twice on the Willie Meena, but before I get
through with him he&#8217;ll knock a corner off the mountain every time he sees
my dust. He&#8217;ll be <i>gone</i>, you understand&#8211;it&#8217;ll be moving
day for him&#8211;but I&#8217;ll chase him to the hottest stope in hell.
I&#8217;m going to bust him, savvy, just to learn these other dastards not to
start any rough stuff with me. And now the road, the road! We&#8217;ll just get
him to build it&#8211;I&#8217;ve got it all framed up!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a bluff to kiss her, then ran out and mounted his horse and went
rollicking off towards Blackwater. Wilhelmina brushed her cheek and gazed
angrily after him, then smiled and turned away with a sigh.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SHORT SPORTS</span></h2>

<p>The booming mining camp of Blackwater stood under the rim of a high mesa,
between it and an alkali flat, and as Wunpost rode in he looked it over
critically, though with none too friendly eyes. Being laid out in a land of
magnificent distances, there was plenty of room between the houses, and the
broad main street seemed more suited for driving cattle than for accommodating
the scant local traffic. There had been a time when all that space was needed to
give swing-room to twenty-mule teams, but that time was past and the two sparse
rows of houses seemed dwarfed and pitifully few. Yet there were new ones going
up, and quite a sprinkling of tents; and down on the corner Wunpost saw a big
building which he knew must be Judson Eells&#8217; bank.</p>

<p>It had sprung up in his absence, a pretentious structure of solid concrete,
and as he jogged along past it Wunpost swung his head and looked it over
scornfully. The walls were thick and strong, but that was no great credit, for
in that desert country any man who would get water could mix concrete until he
was tired. All in the world he had to do was to scoop up the ground and pour the
mud into the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>molds,
and when it was set he had a natural concrete, composed of lime and coarse
gravel and bone-dry dust. Half the burro-corrals in Blackwater were built out of
concrete, but Eells had put up a big false front. This had run into money, the
ornately stamped tin-work having been shipped all the way from Los Angeles; and
there were two plate-glass windows that framed a passing view of marble pillars
and shining brass grilles. Wunpost took it all in and then hissed through his
teeth&#8211;the money that had built it was his!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll skin him!&#8221; he muttered, and pulled up down the street
before Old Whiskers&#8217; populous saloon. Several men drifted out to speak to
him as he tied his horse and pack, but he greeted them all with such a venomous
glare that they shied off and went across the street. There there stood a rival
saloon, rushed up in Wunpost&#8217;s absence; but after looking it over he went
into Whiskers&#8217; Place, which immediately began to fill up. The coming of
Wunpost had been noted from afar, and a man who buys his grub with jewelry
gold-specimens is sure to have a following. He slouched in sulkily and gazed at
Old Whiskers, who was chewing on his tobacco like a ruminative billygoat and
pretending to polish the bar. It was borne in on Whiskers that he had refused
Wunpost a drink on the day he had walked out of camp, but he was hoping that the
slight was forgotten; for if he could keep him in his saloon all the others
would soon be vacated, now that Wunpost was the talk of the town. He had found
one mine and lost it and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_93'></a>93</span>gone out and found another one while the rest of them
were wearing out shoe-leather; and a man like that could not be ignored by the
community, no matter if he did curse their town. So Whiskers chewed on, not
daring to claim his friendship, and Wunpost leaned against the bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme a drink,&#8221; he said laying fifteen cents before him; and as
several men moved forward he scowled at them in silence and tossed off his
<i>solamente</i>. &#8220;Cr-ripes!&#8221; he shuddered, &#8220;did you make that
yourself?&#8221; And when Whiskers, caught unawares, half acquiesced, Wunpost
drew himself up and burst forth. &#8220;I believe it!&#8221; he announced with
an oracular nod, &#8220;I can taste the burnt sugar, the fusel oil, the wood
alcohol and everything. One drink of that stuff would strike a stone Injun blind
if it wasn&#8217;t for this dry desert air. They tell me, Whiskers, that when
you came to this town you brought one barrel of whiskey with you&#8211;and that
you ain&#8217;t ordered another one since. That stuff is all right for those
that like it&#8211;I&#8217;m going across the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode out the door, taking the fickle crowd with him and leaving Old
Whiskers to chew the cud of brooding bitterness. In the saloon across the street
a city barkeeper greeted Wunpost affably, and inquired what it would be. Wunpost
asked for a drink and the discerning barkeeper set out a bottle with the seal
uncut. It was bonded goods, guaranteed seven years in the wood, and Wunpost
smacked his lips as he tasted it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>&#8220;Have one
yourself,&#8221; he suggested and while the crowd stood agape he laid down a
nugget of gold.</p>

<p>That settled it with Blackwater, they threw their money on the bar and tried
to get him drunk, but Wunpost would drink with none of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you bunch of bootlickers!&#8221; he shouted angrily, &#8220;go on
away, I won&#8217;t have nothing to do with you! When I was broke you
wouldn&#8217;t treat me and now that I&#8217;m flush I reckon I can buy my own
liquor. You&#8217;re all sucking around old Eells, saying he made the
town&#8211;I made your danged town myself! Didn&#8217;t I discover the Willie
Meena&#8211;and ain&#8217;t that what made the town? Well, go chase yourselves,
you suckers, I&#8217;m through with ye! You did me dirt when you thought I was
cleaned and now you can all go to blazes!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook hands with the friendly barkeeper, told him to keep the change, and
fought his way out to the street. The crowd of boomers, still refusing to be
insulted, trooped shamelessly along in his wake; and when he unpacked his mule
and took out two heavy, heavy ore-sacks even Judson Eells cast aside his
dignity. He had looked on from afar, standing in front of the plate-glass window
which had &#8220;Willie Meena Mining Company&#8221; across it; but at a signal
from Lynch, who had been acting as his lookout, he came running to demand his
rights. The acquisition of The Wunpost and The Willie Meena properties had by no
means satisfied his lust; and since this one crazy prospector&#8211;who of all
men he had grubstaked <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_95'></a>95</span>seemed the only one who could find a mine&#8211;had
for the third time come in with rich ore, he felt no compunctions about claiming
his share.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get that ore?&#8221; he demanded of Wunpost as the
crowd opened up before him and Wunpost glanced at him fleeringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stole it!&#8221; he said and went on sorting out specimens which he
stuffed into his well-worn overalls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you <i>where</i>!&#8221; returned Eells, drawing his lip up
sternly, and Wunpost turned to the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221; he jeered, &#8220;I told you he was crooked. He wants
to go and steal some himself.&#8221; He laughed, long and loud, and some there
were who joined in with him, for Eells was not without his enemies. To be sure
he had built the bank, and established his offices in Blackwater when he might
have started a new town at the mine; but no moneylender was ever universally
popular and Eells was ruthless in exacting his usury. But on the other hand he
had brought a world of money in to town, for the Willie Meena had paid from the
first; and it was his pay-roll and the wealth which had followed in his wake
that had made the camp what it was; so no one laughed as long or as loud as John
C. Calhoun and he hunched his shoulders and quit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind where I stole it!&#8221; he said to Eells, &#8220;I
stole it, and that&#8217;s enough. Is there anything in your contract that gives
you a cut on everything I <i>steal</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, no,&#8221; replied Eells, &#8220;but that isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>the point&#8211;I
asked you where you got it. If it&#8217;s stolen, that&#8217;s one thing, but if
you&#8217;ve located another mine&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t!&#8221; put in Wunpost, &#8220;you&#8217;ve broke me
of that. The only way I can keep anything now is to steal it. Because, no matter
what it is, if I come by it honestly, you and your rabbit-faced lawyer will grab
it; but if I go out and steal it you don&#8217;t dare to claim half, because
that would make you out a thief. And of course a banker, and a big mining
magnate, and the owner of the famous Willie Meena&#8211;well, it just
isn&#8217;t done, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He twisted up his lips in a wry, sarcastic smile but Eells was not
susceptible to irony. He was the bulldog type of man, the kind that takes hold
and hangs on, and he could see that the ore was rich. It was so rich indeed that
in those two sacks alone there were undoubtedly several thousand
dollars&#8211;and the mine itself might be worth millions. Eells turned and
beckoned to Phillip F. Lapham, who was looking on with greedy eyes. They
consulted together while Wunpost waited calmly, though with the battle light in
his eyes, and at last Eells returned to the charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Calhoun,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no use to pretend
that this ore which you have is stolen. We have seen samples of it before and it
is very unusual&#8211;in fact, no one has seen anything like it. Therefore your
claim that it is stolen is a palpable pretense, to deprive me of my rights under
our constitution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;
prompted Wunpost, dropping his hand on his pistol, and Eells paused and glanced
at Lapham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he conceded, &#8220;of course I can&#8217;t prove
anything and&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you bet you can&#8217;t prove anything,&#8221; spoke up Wunpost
defiantly, &#8220;and you can&#8217;t touch an ounce of my ore. It&#8217;s mine
and I stole it and no court can make me show where; because a man can&#8217;t be
compelled to incriminate himself&#8211;and if I showed you they could come out
and pinch me. Huh! You&#8217;ve got a lawyer, have you? Well, I&#8217;ve got one
myself and I know my legal rights and if any man puts out his hand to take away
this bag, I&#8217;ve got a right to shoot him dead! Ain&#8217;t that right now,
Mr. Flip Flappum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;the law gives one the right to defend his own property; but
only with sufficient force to resist the attack, and to shoot would be
excessive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with me!&#8221; asserted Wunpost, &#8220;I&#8217;ve consulted one
of the best lawyers in Nevada and I&#8217;m posted on every detail.
There&#8217;s Pisen-face Lynch, that everybody knows is a gun-man in the employ
of Judson Eells, and at the first crooked move I&#8217;d be justified in killing
him and then in killing you and Eells. Oh, I&#8217;ll law you, you dastards,
I&#8217;ll law you with a six-shooter&#8211;and I&#8217;ve got an attorney all
hired to defend me. We&#8217;ve agreed on his fee and I&#8217;ve got it all
buried where he can go get it when I give him the directions; and I hope he gets
it soon because then there&#8217;ll be just three less grafters, to rob honest
prospectors of their rights.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>He advanced upon
Lapham, his great head thrust out as he followed his squirming flight through
the crowd; and when he was gone he turned upon Eells who stood his ground with
insolent courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, you big slob,&#8221; he went on threateningly, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t need to think you&#8217;ll git off. I ain&#8217;t afraid of your
gun-man, and I ain&#8217;t afraid of you, and before we get through I&#8217;m
going to <i>git</i> you. Well, laugh if you want to&#8211;it&#8217;s your scalp
or mine&#8211;and you can jest politely go to hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers in his face and, taking a sack in both hands, started
off to the Wells Fargo office; and, so intimidated for once were Eells and his
gun-fighter, that neither one followed along after him. Wunpost deposited his
treasure in the Express Company&#8217;s safe and went off to care for his
animals and, while the crowd dispersed to the several saloons, Eells and Lapham
went into conference. This sudden glib quoting of moot points of law was a new
and disturbing factor, and Lapham himself was quite unstrung over the news of
the buried retainer. It had all the earmarks of a criminal lawyer&#8217;s work,
this tender solicitude for his fee; and some shysters that Lapham knew would
even encourage their client to violence, if it would bring them any nearer to
the gold. But this gold&#8211;where did it come from? Could it possibly be
high-graded, in spite of all the testimony to the contrary? And if not, if his
claim that it was stolen was a blind, then how could they discover its
whereabouts? Certainly not by force of law, and not by any violence&#8211;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>must resort to guile,
the old cunning of the serpent, which now differentiates man from the beasts of
the field, and perhaps they could get Wunpost drunk!</p>

<p>Happy thought! The wires were laid and all Blackwater joined in with them, in
fact it was the universal idea, and even the new barkeeper with whom Wunpost had
struck up an acquaintance had promised to do his part. To get Wunpost drunk and
then to make him boast, to pique him by professed doubts of his great find; and
then when he spilled it, as he had always done before, the wild rush and another
great boom! They watched his every move as he put his animals in a corral and
stored his packs and saddles; and when, in the evening, he drifted back to The
Mint, man after man tried to buy him a drink. But Wunpost was antisocial, he
would have none of their whiskey and their canting professions of friendship;
only Ben Fellowes, the new barkeeper, was good enough for his society and he
joined him in several libations. It was all case goods, very soft and smooth and
velvety, and yet in a remarkably short space of time Wunpost was observed to be
getting garrulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, pardner,&#8221; he said taking the barkeeper by
the arm and speaking very confidently into his ear, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,
it&#8217;s this way with me. I&#8217;m a Calhoun, see&#8211;John C. Calhoun is
my name, and I come from the state of Kentucky&#8211;and a Kentucky Calhoun
never forgets a friend, and he never forgets an enemy. I&#8217;m burned out on
this town&#8211;don&#8217;t <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span>like it&#8211;nothing about it&#8211;but you, now,
you&#8217;re different, you never done me any injury. You&#8217;re my friend,
ain&#8217;t that right, you&#8217;re my friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>The barkeeper reassured him and held his breath while he poured out another
drink and then, as Wunpost renewed his protestations, Fellowes thanked him for
his present of the nugget.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;<i>that</i>?&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost brushing the piece of
gold aside, &#8220;that&#8217;s nothing&#8211;here, give you a good one!&#8221;
He drew out a chunk of rock fairly encrusted with gold and forced it roughly
upon him. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing!&#8221; he said, &#8220;lots more where that
came from. Got system, see&#8211;know how to find it. All these water-hole
prospectors, they never find nothing&#8211;too lazy, won&#8217;t get out and
hunt. I head for the high places&#8211;leap from crag to crag, see, like
mountain sheep&#8211;come back with my pockets full of gold. These bums are no
good&#8211;I could take &#8217;em out tonight and lead &#8217;em to my mine and
they&#8217;d never be able to go back. Rough country &#8217;n all that&#8211;no
trails, steep as the devil&#8211;take &#8217;em out there and lose &#8217;em,
every time. Take you out and lose you&#8211;now say, you&#8217;re my friend,
I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped with portentous dignity and poured out another drink and the
barkeeper frowned a hanger-on away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you out there,&#8221; went on Wunpost, &#8220;and show
you my mine&#8211;show you the place where I get all this gold. You can pick up
all you want, and when we get back you give me a thousand dollar bill.
That&#8217;s all I ask is a thousand dollar <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span>bill&#8211;like to have one to flash on the
boys&#8211;and then we&#8217;ll go to Los and blow the whole pile&#8211;by grab,
I&#8217;m a high-roller, right. I&#8217;m a good feller, see, as long as
you&#8217;re my friend, but don&#8217;t tip off this place to old Eells. Have to
kill you if you do&#8211;he&#8217;s bad actor&#8211;robbed me twice.
What&#8217;s matter&#8211;ain&#8217;t you got the dollar bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said a thousand dollars!&#8221; spoke up the barkeeper
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thousand dollar bill, then. Ain&#8217;t you got
it&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter? Aw, gimme another drink&#8211;you&#8217;re
nothing but a bunch of short sports.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head and sighed and as the barkeeper began to sweat he caught
the hanger-on&#8217;s eye. It was Pisen-face Lynch and he was winking at him
fiercely, meanwhile tapping his own pocket significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get it,&#8221; ventured the barkeeper but Wunpost ignored
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all short sports,&#8221; he asserted drunkenly, waving
his hand insultingly at the crowd. &#8220;You&#8217;re cheap guys&#8211;you
can&#8217;t bear to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; broke in the barkeeper, &#8220;I said I&#8217;d take you
up. I&#8217;ll get the thousand dollars, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you will, eh?&#8221; murmured Wunpost and then he shook himself
together. &#8220;Oh&#8211;sure! Yes, all right! Come on, we&#8217;ll start right
now!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STINGING LIZARD</span></h2>

<p>In a certain stratum of society, now about to become extinct, it is
considered quite <i>au fait</i> to roll a drunk if circumstances will permit. And
it was from this particular stratum that the barkeeper at The Mint had derived
his moral concepts. Therefore he considered it no crime, no betrayal of a trust,
to borrow the thousand dollars with which he was to pay John C. Calhoun from
that prince of opportunists, Judson Eells. It is not every banker that will
thrust a thousand dollar bill&#8211;and the only one he has on hand&#8211;upon a
member of the bungstarters&#8217; brotherhood; but a word in his ear from
Pisen-face Lynch convinced Fellowes that it would be well to run straight. Fate
had snatched him from behind the bar to carry out a part not unconnected with
certain schemes of Judson Eells and any tendency to run out on his trusting
backers would be visited with summary punishment. At least that was what he
gathered in the brief moment they had together before Lynch gave him the money
and disappeared.</p>

<p>As for John C. Calhoun, a close student of inebriety <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>might have noticed that he became sober
too quick; but he invested their departure in such a wealth of mystery that the
barkeeper was more than satisfied. A short ways out of town Wunpost turned out
into the rocks and milled around for an hour; and then, when their trail was
hopelessly lost, he led the way into the hills. Being a stranger in the country
Fellowes could not say what wash it was, but they passed up <i>some</i> wash and
from that into another one; and so on until he was lost; and the most he could
do was to drop a few white beans from the pocketful that Lynch had provided. The
night was very dark and they rode on interminably, camping at dawn in a shut-in
canyon; and so on for three nights until his mind became a blank as far as
direction was concerned. His liberal supply of beans had been exhausted the
first night and since then they had passed over a hundred rocky hog-backs and
down a thousand boulder-strewn canyons. As to the whereabouts of Blackwater he
had no more idea than a cat that has been carried in a bag; and he lacked that
intimate sense of direction which often enables the cat to come back. He was
lost, and a little scared, when Wunpost stopped in a gulch and showed him a neat
pile of rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s my monument,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ain&#8217;t that a
neat piece of work? I learned how to make them from a surveyor. This tobacco can
here contains my notice of location&#8211;that was a steer when I said it
wasn&#8217;t staked. Git down and help yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>He assisted his companion, who was slightly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_104'></a>104</span>saddle-sore, to alight and inspect the monument and
then he waited expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the mine! The mine!&#8221; cried Wunpost gaily. &#8220;Come
along&#8211;have you got your sack? Well, bring along a sack and we&#8217;ll
fill it so full of gold it&#8217;ll bust and spill out going home. Be a nice way
to mark the trail, if you should want to come back sometime&#8211;and by the
way, have you got that thousand dollar bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; whined the barkeeper, &#8220;but
where&#8217;s your cussed mine? This don&#8217;t look like nothing to
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; expounded Wunpost, &#8220;you
haven&#8217;t got my system&#8211;they&#8217;s no use for you to turn
prospector. Now look in this crack&#8211;notice that stuff up and down there?
Well, now, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d look to find gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jee-rusalem!&#8221; exclaimed the barkeeper, or words to that effect,
and dropped down to dig out the rock. It was the very same ore that Wunpost had
shown when he had entered The Mint at Blackwater, only some of it was actually
richer than any of the pieces he had seen. And there was a six-inch streak of
it, running down into the country-rock as if it were going to China. He dug and
dug again while Wunpost, all unmindful, unpacked and cooked a good meal.
Fellowes filled his small sack and all his pockets and wrapped up the rest in
his handkerchief; and before they packed to go he borrowed the dish-towel and
went back for a last hoard of gold. It was there for the taking, and he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>have all he wanted
as long as he turned over the thousand dollar bill. Wunpost was insistent upon
this and as they prepared to start he accepted it as payment in full.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>my</i> idea of money!&#8221; he exclaimed admiringly as
he smoothed the silken note across his knee. &#8220;A thousand dollar bill, and
you could hide it inside your ear&#8211;say, wait till I pull that in Los!
I&#8217;ll walk up to the bar in my old, raggedy clothes and if the barkeep
makes any cracks about paying in advance I&#8217;ll just drop <i>that</i> down
on the mahogany. That&#8217;ll learn him, by grab, to keep a civil tongue in his
head and to say Mister when he&#8217;s speaking to a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned at the Judas that he had taken to his bosom but Fellowes did not
respond. He was haunted by a fear that the simple-minded Wunpost might ask him
where he got that big bill, since it is rather out of the ordinary for even a
barkeeper to have that much money in his clothes; but the simple-minded Wunpost
was playing a game of his own and he asked no embarrassing questions. It was
taken for granted that they were both gentlemen of integrity, each playing his
own system to win, and the barkeeper&#8217;s nervous fear that the joker would
pop up somewhere found no justification in fact. He had his gold, all he could
carry of it, and Wunpost had his thousand dollar bill, and now nothing remained
to hope for but a quick trip home and a speedy deliverance from his misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, for cripes&#8217; sake,&#8221; he wailed, &#8220;ain&#8217;t they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>any short-cut home?
I&#8217;m so lame I can hardly walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is,&#8221; admitted Wunpost, &#8220;I could have you home
by morning. But you might take to dropping that gold, like you did them Boston
beans, and I&#8217;d come back to find my mine jumped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t drop no gold!&#8221; protested Fellowes earnestly,
&#8220;and them beans was just for a joke. Always read about it, you know, in
these here lost treasure stories; but shucks, I didn&#8217;t mean no
harm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; nodded Wunpost, &#8220;if I&#8217;d thought you did
I&#8217;d have ditched you, back there in the rocks. But I&#8217;ll tell you
what I <i>will</i> do&#8211;you let me keep you blindfolded and I&#8217;ll get
you out of here quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on!&#8221; agreed Fellowes and Wunpost whipped out his
handkerchief and bound it across his whole face. They rode on interminably, but
it was always down hill and the sagacious Mr. Fellowes even noted a deep gorge
through which water was rushing in a torrent. Shortly after they passed through
it he heard a rooster crow and caught the fragrance of hay and not long after
that they were out on the level where he could smell the rank odor of the
creosote. Just at daylight they rode into Blackwater from the south, for Wunpost
was still playing the game, and half an hour later every prospector was out,
ostensibly hunting for his burros. But Wunpost&#8217;s work was done, he turned
his animals into the corral and retired for some much-needed <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>sleep; and when he awoke
the barkeeper was gone, along with everybody else in town.</p>

<p>The stampede was to the north and then up Jail Canyon, where there was the
only hay ranch for miles; and then up the gorge and on almost to Panamint, where
the tracks turned off up Woodpecker Canyon. They were back-tracking of course,
for the tracks really came down it, but before the sun had set Wunpost&#8217;s
monument was discovered, together with the vein of gold. It was astounding,
incredible, after all his early efforts, that he should let them back-track him
to his mine; but that was what he had done and Pisen-face Lynch was not slow to
take possession of the treasure. There was no looting of the paystreak as there
had been at the Willie Meena, a guard was put over it forthwith; and after he
had taken a few samples from the vein Lynch returned on the gallop to
Blackwater.</p>

<p>The great question now with Eells was how Wunpost would take it, but after
hearing from his scouts that the prospector was calm he summoned him to his
office. It seemed too good to be true, but so it had seemed before when Calhoun
had given up the Wunpost and the Willie Meena; and when Lynch brought him in
Eells was more than pleased to see that his victim was almost smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, followed me up again, eh?&#8221; he observed sententiously, and
Eells inclined his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Mr. Lynch followed your trail <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>and&#8211;well, we have
already taken possession of the mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the contract?&#8221; inquired Wunpost and when Eells assented
Wunpost shut his lips down grimly. &#8220;Good!&#8221; he said, &#8220;now
I&#8217;ve got you where I want you. We&#8217;re partners, ain&#8217;t that it,
under our contract? And you don&#8217;t give a whoop for justice or nothing as
long as you get it <i>all</i>! Well, you&#8217;ll get it, Mr. Eells&#8211;do you
recognize this thousand dollar bill? That was given to me by a barkeep named
Fellowes, but of course he received it from you. I knowed where he got it, and I
knowed what he was up to&#8211;I ain&#8217;t quite as easy as I look&#8211;and
now I&#8217;m going to take it and give it to a lawyer, and start in to get my
rights. Yes, I&#8217;ve got some rights, too&#8211;never thought of that, did
ye&#8211;and I&#8217;m going to demand &#8217;em <i>all</i>! I&#8217;m going to
go to this lawyer and put this bill in his hand and tell him to git me my
<i>rights</i>! Not part of &#8217;em, not nine tenths of &#8217;em&#8211;I want
&#8217;em <i>all</i>&#8211;and by grab, I&#8217;m going to
<i>get</i>&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck the mahogany table a resounding whack and Eells jumped and glanced
warningly at Lynch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call for a receiver, or whatever you call him, to
look after my interests at the mine; and if the judge won&#8217;t appoint him
I&#8217;m going to have you summoned to bring the Wunpost books into court. And
I&#8217;m going to prove by those books that you robbed me of my interest and
never made any proper accounting; and then, by grab, he&#8217;ll <i>have</i> to
appoint him, and I&#8217;ll get all that&#8217;s coming to me, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span> and you&#8217;ll get
what&#8217;s coming to <i>you</i>. You&#8217;ll be shown up for what you are, a
low-down, sneaking thief that would steal the pennies from a blind man;
you&#8217;ll be showed up right, you and your sure-thing contract, and
you&#8217;ll get a little <i>publicity</i>! I&#8217;ll just give this to the
press, along with some four-bit cigars and the drinks all around for the boys,
and we&#8217;ll just see where you stand when you get your next rating from
Bradstreet&#8211;I&#8217;ll put your tin-front bank on the bum! And then
I&#8217;ll say to my lawyer, and he&#8217;s a slippery son-of-a-goat: &#8216;Go to it
and see how much you can get&#8211;and for every dollar you collect, by hook,
crook or book, I&#8217;ll give you back a half of it! Sue Eells for an
accounting every time he ships a brick&#8211;make him pay back what he stole on
the Wunpost&#8211;give him fits over the Willie Meena&#8211;and if a half
ain&#8217;t enough, send him broke and you can have it <i>all</i>! Do you reckon
I&#8217;ll get some results?&#8221;</p>

<p>He asked this last softly, bowing his bristling head to where he could look
Judson Eells in the eye, and the oppressor of the poor took counsel. Undoubtedly
he <i>would</i> get certain results, some of which were very unpleasant to
contemplate, but behind it all he felt something yet to come, some
counter-proposal involving peace. For no man starts out by laying his cards on
the table unless he has an ace in the hole&#8211;or unless he is running a
bluff. And he knew, and Wunpost knew, that the thing which irked him most was
that sure-fire Prospector&#8217;s Contract. There Eells had the high card and if
he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> played his hand
well he might tame this impassioned young orator. His lawyer was not yet
retained, none of the suits had been brought, and perhaps they never would be
brought. Yet undoubtedly Wunpost had consulted some attorney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;yes,&#8221; admitted Eells, &#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure
you&#8217;d get results&#8211;but whether they would be the results you
anticipate is quite another question. I have a lawyer of my own, quite a
competent man and one in whom I can trust, and if it comes to a suit
there&#8217;s one thing you <i>can&#8217;t</i> break and that is your
Prospector&#8217;s Contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and over Wunpost&#8217;s scowling face there flashed a twinge that
betrayed him&#8211;Judson Eells had read his inner thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow,&#8221; he blustered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll deal you so much
misery&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessary, not necessary,&#8221; put in Judson Eells mildly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to meet you half way. What is it you want now, and if
it&#8217;s anything reasonable I&#8217;ll be glad to consider a settlement.
Litigation is expensive&#8211;it takes time and it takes money&#8211;and
I&#8217;m willing to do what is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gimme back that contract!&#8221; blurted out Wunpost
desperately, &#8220;and you can keep your doggoned mine. But if you don&#8217;t
by grab I&#8217;ll fight you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; replied Eells regretfully,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you, Mr. Calhoun, why. You&#8217;re just one of
forty-odd men that have signed those Prospector&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>Contracts, and there&#8217;s a certain
principle involved. I paid out thirty thousand dollars before I got back a
nickel and I can&#8217;t afford to establish a precedent. If I let you buy out,
they will all want to buy out&#8211;that is, if they&#8217;ve happened to find a
mine&#8211;and the result will be that there&#8217;ll be trouble and litigation
every time I claim my rights. When you were wasting my grubstake I never said a
word, because that, in a way, was your privilege; and now that, for some reason,
you are stumbling onto mines, you ought to recognize my rights. It is a part of
my policy, as laid down from the first, under no circumstances to ever release
anybody; otherwise some dishonest prospector might be tempted to conceal his
find in the hope of getting title to it later. But now about this mine, which
you have named The Stinging Lizard&#8211;what would be your top price for
cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want that contract,&#8221; returned Wunpost doggedly but Judson
Eells shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about ten thousand dollars?&#8221; suggested Eells at last,
&#8220;for a quit-claim on the Stinging Lizard Mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing!&#8221; flashed back Wunpost, &#8220;I don&#8217;t sign
no quit-claim&#8211;nor no other paper, for that matter. You might have it
treated with invisible ink, or write something else in, up above. But&#8211;aw
cripes, dang these lawyers, I don&#8217;t want to monkey around&#8211;gimme a
hundred thousand dollars and she&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;The
Stinging Lizard?&#8221; inquired Eells and wrote it absently on his blotter at
which Wunpost began to sweat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>sign</i> nothing!&#8221; he reminded him, and Eells
smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, you can acknowledge it before witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t acknowledge nothing!&#8221; insisted Wunpost
stubbornly, &#8220;and you&#8217;ve got to put the money in my hand. How about
fifty thousand dollars and make it all cash, and I&#8217;ll agree to get out of
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o, I haven&#8217;t that much on hand at this time,&#8221; observed
Judson Eells, frowning thoughtfully. &#8220;I might give you a draft on Los
Angeles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;cash!&#8221; challenged Wunpost, &#8220;how much have you
got? Count it over and make me an offer&#8211;I want to get out of this
town.&#8221; He muttered uneasily and paced up and down while Judson Eells, with
ponderous surety, opened up the chilled steel vault. He ran through bundles and
neat packages, totting up as he went, and then with a face as frozen as a stone
he came out with the currency in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got twenty thousand dollars that I suppose I can
spare,&#8221; he began as he spread out the money, but Wunpost cut him
short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you can have the
Stinging Lizard&#8211;but my word&#8217;s all the quit claim you get!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stuffed the money into his pockets without <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>stopping to count it, more like a
burglar than a seller of mines, and that night while the town gathered to gaze
on in wonder he took the stage for Los Angeles. No one shouted good-by and he
did not look back, but as they pulled out of Blackwater he smiled.</p>

<p>The dry heat of July gave way to the muggy heat of August and as the
September storms began to gather along the summits Wunpost Calhoun returned to
his own. It was his own country, after all, this land of desert spaces and
jagged mountains reared up again the sky; and he came back in style, riding a
big, round-bellied mule and leading another one packed. He had a rifle under his
knee, a pistol on his hip and a pair of field glasses in a case on the horn; and
he rode in on a trot, looking about with a knowing smile that changed suddenly
to a smirk of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he exclaimed as he saw Eells emerge from the bank,
&#8220;how&#8217;s the mine, Mr. Eells; how&#8217;s the mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Judson Eells, who had rushed out at the rumor of his approach, drew up
his lip and glared at him hatefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a criminal!&#8221; he bellowed, &#8220;I could have you
jailed for this&#8211;that Stinging Lizard mine was salted!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell you say!&#8221; shrilled Wunpost and then <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>he laughed uproariously
while he did a little jig in his stirrups. &#8220;Yeee&#8211;hoo!&#8221; he
yelled, &#8220;say, that&#8217;s pretty good! Have you any idee who done
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did it!&#8221; answered Eells, &#8220;and I could have you
arrested for it, only I don&#8217;t want to have any trouble. But you agreed to
leave town and now I see you&#8217;re back&#8211;what&#8217;s the meaning of
this, Mr. Calhoun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too slow inside,&#8221; complained Mr. Calhoun, who was sporting a
brand-new outfit, &#8220;so I thought I&#8217;d come back and shake hands with
my friends and take another look at my mine. Costs money to live in Los Angeles
and I bought me a dog&#8211;looky here, cost me eight hundred
dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached down into a nest which he had hollowed out of the pack and held up
a wilted fox terrier, and as Eells stood speechless he dropped it back into its
cubby-hole and laid a loving hand on the mule.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this for a mule?&#8221; he enquired ingenuously,
&#8220;cost me five hundred dollars in Barstow. Fastest walker in the
West&#8211;picked him out on purpose&#8211;and my pack mule can carry four
hundred. How much did you lose on the Stinging Lizard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost over thirty thousand dollars, with the road work and
all,&#8221; answered Eells with ponderous exactitude, and Wunpost laughed
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty thousand!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;I wish it was a million! But
you can&#8217;t say that I didn&#8217;t warn you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warn me!&#8221; raged Eells, &#8220;you did nothing of the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>kind. It was a deliberate
attempt to defraud me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, cripes,&#8221; scoffed Wunpost, &#8220;you can&#8217;t win all the
time&#8211;why don&#8217;t you take your medicine like a sport? Didn&#8217;t I
name the danged hole The Stinging Lizard? Well, there was your warning&#8211;but
you got stung!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed heartily at the joke and looked up the street, ignoring the
staring crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, got to go!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where <i>is</i> that road you
built&#8211;like to go up and take a look at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It extends up Jail Canyon,&#8221; returned the banker grimly. &#8220;I
understand Mr. Campbell is using it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty work!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost, &#8220;won&#8217;t be wasted,
anyhow. That&#8217;ll come in right handy for Cole. Why didn&#8217;t you buy the
old hassayamper out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t sell!&#8221; grumbled Eells, &#8220;say, come in here a
minute&#8211;I&#8217;ve got something I want to talk over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way into his inner office, where an electric fan was running, and
Wunpost took off his big, black hat to loll before the breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty nice,&#8221; he pronounced, &#8220;they&#8217;ve got lots of
&#8217;em in Los. But I never suffered so much from heat in my life&#8211;the
poor fools all wear <i>coats</i>! Gimme the desert, every time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve come back to stay, eh?&#8221; inquired Eells
unsociably, &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d left these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep&#8211;left and came back,&#8221; replied Wunpost lightly.
&#8220;Say, how much do you want for that contract? You might as well release
me, because <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_117'></a>117</span>it&#8217;ll never buy <i>you</i>
anything&#8211;you&#8217;ve got all the mines you&#8217;ll get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never release you!&#8221; answered Judson Eells firmly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s against my principles to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, put a price on it,&#8221; burst out Wunpost bluffly, &#8220;you
know you haven&#8217;t got any principles. You&#8217;re out for the dough, the
same as the rest of us, and you figure you&#8217;ll make more by holding on. But
I&#8217;m here to tell you that I&#8217;m getting too slick for you and you
might as well quit while you&#8217;re lucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for any money,&#8221; responded Judson Eells solemnly, &#8220;I am
in this as a matter of principle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahhr, principle!&#8221; scoffed Wunpost. &#8220;You&#8217;re the
crookedest dog that ever drew up a contract&#8211;and then talk to me about
<i>principle</i>! Why don&#8217;t you say what you mean and call it your
system&#8211;like they use trying to break the roulette wheel? But I&#8217;m
telling you your system is played out. I&#8217;ll never locate another claim as
long as I live, unless I&#8217;m released from that contract; so where do you
figure on any more Willie Meenas? All you&#8217;ll get will be Stinging
Lizards.&#8221;</p>

<p>He burst out into taunting laughter but Judson Eells sat dumb, his heavy
lower lip drawn up grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I have reason
to believe that you have located a very rich mine&#8211;and the only way you
personally can ever get a dollar out of it, is to come through and give me
half!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>&#8220;The only
way, eh?&#8221; jeered Wunpost, &#8220;well, where did I get the price to buy
that swell pair of mules? Did I give you one half, or even a smell? Not
much&#8211;and I got this, besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slapped a wad of bills that he drew from his pocket, and Eells knew they
were a part of his payment&#8211;the purchase price of the salted Stinging
Lizard&#8211;but he only looked them over and scowled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing, eh?&#8221; observed Wunpost rising up to go, &#8220;you
won&#8217;t sell that contract for no price. Going to follow me up, eh, and find
this hidden treasure, and skin me out of it, too? Well, hop to it, Mr. Eells,
and after you&#8217;ve got a bellyful perhaps you&#8217;ll listen to reason. You
got stung good and plenty when you bought the Stinging Lizard and I figure
I&#8217;m pretty well heeled. Got two new mules, beside my other animals, and an
eight hundred dollar watch-dog to keep me company; and I&#8217;m going to come
back inside of a month with my mules loaded down with gold. Do you reckon your
pet rabbit, Mr. Phillip F. Flappum, can make me come through with any part of
it? Well, I consulted a lawyer before I left Los Angeles and he
said&#8211;decidedly not! Your contract calls for claims, wherever located, but
I haven&#8217;t got any claim. This ore that I bring in may be dug from some
claim, and then again it may be high-graded from some mine; but you&#8217;ve got
to find that claim and prove that it exists before you can call for a cent.
You&#8217;ve got to prove, by grab, where I got that gold, before you can claim
that it&#8217;s yours&#8211;and that&#8217;s something you <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>never can do. I&#8217;m going to say I
<i>stole</i> it and if you sue for any part of it you make yourself out a
thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>He slammed his hand on Eells&#8217; desk and slammed the door when he went
out and mounted his big mule with a swagger. The citizens of Blackwater made way
for him promptly, though many a lip curled in scorn, and he rode out of town
sitting sideways in his saddle while he did a little jig in his stirrups. He had
come into town and bearded their leading citizen and now he was on his way. If
any wished to follow, that was their privilege as free citizens, and their
efforts might lead them to a mine; but on the other hand they might lead them up
some very rocky canyons and down through Death Valley in summer. But there was
one man he knew would follow, for the stakes were high and Judson Eells was not
to be denied&#8211;it was up to Lynch, who had claimed to be so bad, to prove
himself a tracker and a desert-man.</p>

<p>Wunpost rode along slowly until the sun went down, for the heat-haze hung
black over the Sink, and that evening about midnight he entered Jail Canyon on a
road that was graded like a boulevard. It swung around the point well up above
the creek, and then on along the wash to Corkscrew Gorge, and as he paused below
the house Wunpost chuckled to himself as he thought of his boasts to Wilhelmina.
He had bet her two months before that, without turning his hand over or spending
a cent of money, he could build her father a road; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>and now here it was, laid out like a
highway&#8211;a proof that his system would work. She had chosen to scoff when
he had made his big talk; but here he was back with his clothes full of money,
and Judson Eells had kindly built the road. He looked up at the moon, where it
rose swimming through the haze, and laughed until he shook; then he camped and
waited for day.</p>

<p>The dawn came in a wave of heat, preceding the sun like the breath from a
furnace; and Wunpost woke up suddenly to hear his wilted terrier barking
furiously as he raced towards the house. There was a moment of silence, then the
spit and yell of a cat and as Wunpost stood grinning his dog came slinking back
licking the blood from a scratch across his nose. He was a fullblooded fox
terrier, but small and white and trembly; and the baby-blue in his eyes pleaded
of youth and inexperience as he crouched before his stern master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here!&#8221; commanded Wunpost but as he reached down to slap him
a voice called his name from above.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> whip him!&#8221; it begged and Wunpost withheld his
hand for Wilhelmina had been much in his mind. She came dancing down the trail,
her curls tumbling about her face and down over the perennial bib-overalls, and
when the pup saw her he left his scowling master and crept meechingly to take
refuge at her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was chasing Red,&#8221; she dimpled, &#8220;and you know how fierce
he is&#8211;why, Red isn&#8217;t afraid of a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_121'></a>121</span>wildcat! Where have you been? We&#8217;ve all been
looking for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles,&#8221; responded Wunpost with a sigh,
&#8220;but, by grab, I never thought that this dog of mine would get licked by
an old yaller cat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t yellow&#8211;he&#8217;s red!&#8221; corrected
Wilhelmina briskly, &#8220;the desert makes all yellow cats red; but
where&#8217;d you get your dog? And oh, yes; isn&#8217;t it fine&#8211;how do
you like our new road? They had it built up to your mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I hear,&#8221; returned Wunpost with a grim twinkle in his eye,
&#8220;what do you think of my system now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what system?&#8221; asked Billy, staring blankly into his face,
and Wunpost pulled down his lip. Was it possible that this fly-away had taken
his words so lightly that she had forgotten his exposition and prophecy? Did she
think that this road had come there by accident and not by deep-laid design? He
called back his dog and made him lie down behind him and then he changed the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your father getting along?&#8221; he asked after a
silence, &#8220;has he shipped out any ore? Well say, you tell &#8217;im to get
a move on. There&#8217;s liable to be a cloudburst and wash the whole road out,
and then where&#8217;d you be with your home stake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess there hasn&#8217;t been one for over twelve
years,&#8221; answered Billy snapping her fingers enticingly to his dog,
&#8220;and besides, it&#8217;s so hot the trucks can&#8217;t gull up the
canyon&#8211;it makes their radiators <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_122'></a>122</span>boil. But we&#8217;ve got it all sacked and when
Father gets his payment I&#8217;m going inside, to school. Isn&#8217;t it fine,
after all they said about Dad&#8211;calling him crazy and everything
else&#8211;and now his mine is worth lots and lots of money! I knew all the time
he would win! And Eells has been up here and offered us forty thousand dollars,
but Father wouldn&#8217;t even consider it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stepped over boldly and picked up the dog, who wriggled frantically and
tried to lick her face, and Wunpost stood mumbling to himself. So now it was her
father who was getting all the credit for this wonderful stroke of luck; and he
and the others who had called old Cole crazy were proven by the event to be
fools. And yet he had packed ore for over two weeks to salt the Stinging Lizard
for Eells!</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your mules in the corral and come up to breakfast!&#8221; cried
Billy starting off for the house; and then she dropped his dog, which ran
capering along behind her&#8211;and Wunpost had named it Good Luck! If she stole
his dog on top of everything else, he would learn about women from her.</p>

<p>There was a cordial welcome at the house from Mrs. Campbell, who was radiant
with joy over their good fortune; but Wunpost avoided the subject of the sale of
his mine, for of course she must know it was salted. Anyone would know that
after they had dug down a ways for Wunpost had simply quarried out a vein of
rotten quartz and filled the resultant fissure with high grade. But there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>something in Latin
about <i>caveat emptor</i>, which is short for &#8220;Let the buyer
beware!&#8221; and if Judson Eells was so foolish as to build his road first
that was certainly no fault of Wunpost&#8217;s. All he had done was to locate
the hole, and then Judson Eells had jumped it; and if, as a result thereof,
Wunpost had trimmed him of twenty thousand, that was nothing to what Eells had
done to him. And yet every time he met Mrs. Campbell&#8217;s eye he felt that
she had her reservations about him. He was a mine-salter, a crook, the same as
Eells was a crook; but she welcomed him all the same. Perhaps she held it to his
credit that he had given Billy a full half when he had discovered the Willie
Meena Mine; but it might be, of course, that she was this way with everyone and
simply tolerated him as she did Hungry Bill. He ate a good breakfast, but
without saying much, and then he went back to his camp.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina tagged along, joyous as a child to have company and quite innocent
of what is called maidenly reserve; and Wunpost dug down into his pack and gave
her a bag of candy, at the same time patting her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours truly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;sweets to the sweet, and all that.
Say, what do you think this is?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up a box, which might contain almost anything that was less than six
inches square, and shook his head at all her guesses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on up to the lookout,&#8221; he said at last and she followed
along fearlessly behind him. There <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_124'></a>124</span>are maidens, of course, who would refuse to enter
dark tunnels in the company of masterful young prospectors; but Wilhelmina had
yet to learn both fear and feminine subterfuge and she made no pretty excuses.
She was neither afraid of the dark, nor afflicted with vertigo, nor reminded of
pressing home duties; and she was frankly interested both in the contents of the
box and the ways of a man with a maid. He had given her some candy, and there
was a gift in the little box&#8211;and once before he had made as if to kiss
her; would he now, after bringing his lover&#8217;s gifts, demand the customary
tribute? And if so, should she permit it; and if not, why not?</p>

<p>It was very perplexing and yet Billy was determined not to evade any of the
problems of life. All girls had their suitors; and yet few of them, she knew,
were cast in the heroic mold of Wunpost. He was big and strong, with roving blue
eyes and a smile that was both compelling and shy; and sometimes when he looked
at her she felt a vague tumult, for of course he could kiss her if he would.
When he had assaulted Old Whiskers and seized Dusty Rhodes by the throat, in the
contest over their mine, she had stood in awe of his violence; but except for
that one time when he had attempted to steal a kiss, he had reserved his rough
violence for his enemies. Yet&#8211;and somehow the thought thrilled
her&#8211;it might be, after all, that he was shy; and that playful, bear-like
hug was only his boyish way of hinting at the wish in his heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>It might even be
that he was secretly in love with her, as she had read of other lovers in books;
and that all the time, unknown to her, he was worshiping her beauty from afar.
For she was beautiful, she knew it&#8211;and others had told her so&#8211;and
there are few girls indeed that have curling hair <i>and</i> dimples, but Nature
had given her both. And now if he did not kiss her, or speak from his heart, it
would be because she was dressed like a boy; and she would have to lay aside her
overalls forever. For no one can hope to retain everything in this world, and
life is ours to be lived; and if worst came to worst, she might give up her
freedom and consent to wear millinery and skirts. She sighed and followed on,
and came safely to the portal which looked out on the great world below.</p>

<p>Wunpost sat down deliberately at the mouth of the tunnel, on the broad seat
she had built along the wall, and handed Wilhelmina the package; and as she sank
down beside him the panting fox terrier slumped down at her feet and wheezed.
But Billy failed to notice this sign of affection, for as the package was broken
open a dainty case was exposed and this in turn revealed a pair of glasses. Not
ordinary, cheap field-glasses with rusty round barrels and lenses that refracted
the colors of the rainbow; but exquisitely small ones, with square shoulders on
the sides and quality showing in every line. She caught them up ecstatically and
looked out across the Sink; and Wunpost let her gaze, though <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>her focus was all wrong,
while he made his little speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;next time you see my dust you&#8217;ll
know whether it&#8217;s a man or a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t they fine!&#8221; exclaimed Billy, swinging the
glasses on Blackwater. &#8220;I can see every house in town. And there&#8217;s a
man on the trail&#8211;yes, and another one behind&#8211;I believe they&#8217;re
coming this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably Pisen-face Lynch,&#8221; observed Wunpost unconcernedly,
&#8220;I expected him to be on my trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what for?&#8221; murmured Billy still struggling with the focus.
&#8220;Oh, now I can see them fine! Oh, aren&#8217;t these just
wonderful&#8211;and such little things, too&#8211;are you going to use them to
hunt horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re yours!&#8221; returned Wunpost with a generous
swagger, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got another pair of my own. I&#8217;ll never forget
how you picked me up that time, so this is a kind of present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A present!&#8221; gasped Wilhelmina and then she paused and blushed,
for of course she had known it all the time. They were small glasses, for a
lady, but it was nice of him to say it, and to mention her finding him on the
desert. And now her mother would have to let her keep them, for, they were in
remembrance of her saving his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful kind of you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
never forget it&#8211;and now, won&#8217;t you show me how they work?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>She drew a
little closer, and as her curls brushed his cheek Wunpost reeled as if from a
blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said and gave her a kiss just as if she had really
asked for it.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WITH HAY HOOKS</span></h2>

<p>It is no more than right that the first kiss should be forgiven, especially
if no one is to blame, and Wilhelmina forgave him very sweetly; but there was a
wild, hunted look in Wunpost&#8217;s bold eyes and he wondered what would happen
next. Something had come over him very suddenly and made him forget the
restraint which all ladies, even in overalls, laid upon him; and when their
hands had touched some great force had drawn them together and he had kissed her
before she knew it. But instead of resisting she had yielded for a moment, and
then pushed him away very slowly; and he still remembered, like part of a dream,
her heart beating against his breast. But it was all over now, and she was
toying with the field-glasses which he had brought from the city as a
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how we first came
together? And the first place I looked for when you gave me these glasses was
that wash where you made your two fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d had them then,&#8221; ventured Wunpost at last,
&#8220;you&#8217;d&#8217;ve been able to see me plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;but I found you anyhow. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>Doesn&#8217;t it seem a
long time ago? And it was only the end of last May.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something doing every minute,&#8221; burst out Wunpost gaily,
&#8220;say, I&#8217;ve found two mines this summer! What did old Eells think of
the Stinging Lizard? I hooked him right on that&#8211;he&#8217;ll be careful
what he grabs next time. And when he jumps the next claim of mine I reckon
he&#8217;ll sink a few feet before he builds any more ten thousand dollar
roads!&#8221;</p>

<p>He chuckled and ran his hand through his tumbled hair, which always stood
straight on end, but Billy was looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Eells was up to see us,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;and he
claims you salted that mine. And he even told Father that you located it up our
canyon just on purpose so we could use his road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221; inquired Wunpost teasingly.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you, right here, I was going to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you were just fooling!&#8221; she protested laughing,
&#8220;and I told him you did nothing of the kind. And then Father stepped in,
when he heard what we were talking about, and he told Mr. Eells what he thought
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I did salt the mine!&#8221; spoke up Wunpost quickly,
&#8220;there wasn&#8217;t any fooling there. And, being as I had to locate it
somewhere&#8211;well, the chances are Eells was correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s just the way you talk!&#8221; she burst out
incredulously; &#8220;did you honestly do it on purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I did!&#8221; boasted Wunpost. &#8220;I just <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>stopped over in
Blackwater and told Mr. Eells all about it. So don&#8217;t be worried on
<i>my</i> account&#8211;and he built you a mighty good road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but do you think it was quite right,&#8221; began Billy
indignantly, &#8220;to make Father seem a party to a fraud? It&#8217;s what some
people would call a very shady transaction; but I suppose, of course,
you&#8217;re proud of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure I am!&#8221; returned Wunpost warmly, &#8220;and you
don&#8217;t need to be so high and mighty. I guess I&#8217;m just as good as
your old man or anybody, and I notice he&#8217;s using the road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t though,&#8221; answered Billy, &#8220;if I tell him
what&#8217;s happened! My father is honest, he works for what he gets, and that
road is just the same as stolen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go ahead and tell him!&#8221; challenged Wunpost angrily.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll come to a show-down, right now. And anybody that&#8217;s too
good to use my road is too good to associate with <i>me</i>!&#8221; He brought
down his big fist into the palm of his hand and Wilhelmina jumped at the smack.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you,&#8221; he demanded rising and pointing at her
accusingly, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I say I was going to build that road? Well, why
didn&#8217;t you kick about it <i>then</i>? You were game to follow me up and
jump my mine so your father could build him a road; but the minute I trim old
Eells, who has robbed you of a million, by grab, all of a sudden you get
<i>good</i>! You can&#8217;t bear to use a road that that old skinflint built,
thinking he&#8217;d <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_131'></a>131</span>robbed me of another rich mine! No, that
wouldn&#8217;t be right, that&#8217;s a shady transaction! All right then,
don&#8217;t use the doggoned road!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smashed his fist into his hand in a final sweeping gesture of disdain and
Wilhelmina gazed at him fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were just talking,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;but
don&#8217;t you ever tell Father what&#8217;s happened. If you do he&#8217;ll
never use the road&#8211;or if he does, he&#8217;ll pay Mr. Eells for it. He
tries to be honest in everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and look what it gets him!&#8221; cried Wunpost passionately,
&#8220;he&#8217;s spent half his life in this hell-hole of a canyon and
you&#8217;re chasing around here in overalls! And then when some
<i>crook</i> like me comes along and gives him a ten thousand dollar road this is
all the thanks he gets! I&#8217;m through&#8211;you can rustle for
yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; returned Billy with a wild gleam in her eye,
&#8220;and if you don&#8217;t like my overalls&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; he broke in, &#8220;I like &#8217;em fine&#8211;like
&#8217;em better than those flimsy danged skirts! But if you&#8217;re too good
to use my road&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; interrupted Billy, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
you built the road, but Father looks at it differently. He told Mr. Eells he
wouldn&#8217;t be a party to any such scheme to defraud. But&#8211;now
it&#8217;s all built&#8211;don&#8217;t tell him how you did it; because I want
him to have a little happiness. He&#8217;s been working so long and this came,
as he said, just like an act of Providence; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_132'></a>132</span>so let&#8217;s not tell him, and when he&#8217;s
taken out his ore he can pay Mr. Eells, if he wishes to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s crazy!&#8221; corrected Wunpost. &#8220;What, pay that
crook? Say, do you see those two men on the trail? They&#8217;re hired by Eells
to tag along behind me and trail me to my mine. Now what right has he got to
claim that mine? Did he ever give me a dollar to spend, while I was up there in
the high country looking for it? He did not, and he stole every dollar I had
before I ever went out to prospect. Didn&#8217;t he rob us both of the Willie
Meena&#8211;take it all without giving us a cent? Well, what&#8217;s the sense
of trying to treat him white, when you know he&#8217;s out to do you? His name
is Eells and he skins &#8217;em alive! But you wait&#8211;I&#8217;m out to skin
<i>him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awfully convincing,&#8221; conceded Billy smiling
tremulously, &#8220;but somehow it doesn&#8217;t seem right. Just because he
robs you&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, forget it; forget it!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost impatiently,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t I tell you this is no Sunday school picnic? What&#8217;re
you going to do, let him go on robbing everybody until he has all the money in
the world? No, you&#8217;ve got to play the game&#8211;go after him with the hay
hooks and get his back hair if you can! I&#8217;ve trimmed him of twenty
thousand and a ten thousand dollar road, but where did he get all that coin? He
took it out of our mine, the old Willie Meena, and a whole lot more besides.
Well, whose money was it, anyway&#8211;didn&#8217;t I own the mine first? All
right, then, I reckon it was <i>mine</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>He patted his
pocket, where his roll of bills lay, and smiled roguishly as he grabbed up the
dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine pup, eh?&#8221; he began, &#8220;well, he picked me out
himself&#8211;followed along when I was going down the street. Tried to lose him
and couldn&#8217;t do it, he followed me everywhere, so I kept him and called
him Good Luck. Get the idea? Luck is my pup, he lays down and rolls over
whenever I say the word. Going to make a fine watch-dog if he lives through this
hot weather&#8211;how&#8217;d you like to keep him a while?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like to!&#8221; beamed Billy, &#8220;only I&#8217;m
afraid you might be jealous&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of no pup, kid,&#8221; returned Wunpost with his lordliest
swagger, &#8220;and if you steal him, by grab you can have him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll bet I can do it!&#8221; answered Billy defiantly.
&#8220;And are you still going to give me that mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can find it!&#8221; nodded Wunpost. &#8220;Or I&#8217;ll give
it to Mr. Lynch, if he&#8217;ll promise to follow the leader. I see that&#8217;s
an Injun that he&#8217;s got riding along behind him but I&#8217;m going to lose
&#8217;em both. These Shooshonnies ain&#8217;t so much&#8211;I can out-trail
&#8217;em, any time&#8211;and I tell you what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;m
going to lead Mr. Lynch and his rat-eating guide just as long as they&#8217;re
game to follow, and if they follow me two weeks I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em to my
mine and tell &#8217;em to help themselves. Now that&#8217;s sporting,
ain&#8217;t it? Because the Sockdolager ain&#8217;t staked and she&#8217;s the
richest hole I&#8217;ve struck.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>&#8220;Yes,
it&#8217;s sporting,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;but why don&#8217;t you stake
it? Are you afraid they&#8217;ll take it away from you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;if it was staked
I&#8217;d have half of it! No, I&#8217;m doing this out of pride. I&#8217;m
leaving that claim open and if Mr. Eells can find it he&#8217;s welcome to it
<i>all</i>! But I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;ll never be found!&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded impressively, with a wise, mysterious, smile, and Billy rose up
impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you <i>like</i> to fight,&#8221; she stated accusingly and
Wunpost did not deny it.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>POISONED BAIT</span></h2>

<p>The fight for the Sockdolager Mine was on and Wunpost led off up the canyon
with a swagger. His fast walking mule stepped off at a brisk pace and the
pack-mule, well loaded with provisions and grain, followed along up Judson
Eells&#8217; road. First it led through the Gorge, now clinging to one wall and
now crossing perforce to the other, and as Wunpost saw the work of the
powder-men above him he laughed and slapped his leg. Great masses of rock had
been shot down from the sides, filling up the pot-holes which the cloudburst had
dug; and then, along the sides, a grade had been constructed which gave
clearance for loaded trucks. Past the Gorge, the work showed the signs of
greater haste, as if Eells had driven his men to the limit; but to get through
at all he had had to move much dirt, and that of course had run into money.
Wunpost ambled along luxuriously, chuckling at each heavy job of blasting and at
the spot where Cole Campbell&#8217;s road turned in; and then he swung off up
Woodpecker Canyon to where the Stinging Lizard Mine had been located.</p>

<p>Great timbers still lay where they had been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_136'></a>136</span>dumped from the trucks, there was a concrete
foundation for the engine; and a double-compartment shaft, sunk on the salted
vein, showed what great expectations had been blasted. With the Willie Meena
still sinking on high-grade ore, Judson Eells had taken a good deal for granted
when he had set out to develop the Stinging Lizard. He had squared out his shaft
and sunk on the vein only as far as the muckers could throw out the waste; and
then, instead of installing a windlass or a whim, he had decided upon a
gallows-frame and hoist. But to bring in his machinery he must first have a
road, for the trail was all but impassable; and so, without sinking, he had
blasted his way up the canyon, only to find his efforts wasted. The ore had been
dug out before his engine was installed, thus saving him even greater loss; but
every dollar that he had put into the work had been absolutely thrown away.
Wunpost camped there and gloated and then, shortly after midnight, he set off
with his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<p>The time had now come when he was to match wits with Lynch in the old game of
follow-my-leader and, even with the Indian to do Lynch&#8217;s tracking, he had
no fears for the outcome. There were places on those peaks where a man could
travel for miles without placing his foot on soft ground, and other places in
Death Valley where he could travel in sand that was so powdery it would bog a
butterfly. First the high places, to wear them out and make Pisen-face Lynch get
quarrelsome; and then the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_137'></a>137</span>desolate Valley, with its heat and poison springs,
to put the final touch to his revenge. For it was revenge that Wunpost sought,
revenge on Pisen-face Lynch, who had driven him from two claims with a gun; and
this chase over the hills, which had started so casually, had really been
planned for months. It was part of that &#8220;system&#8221; which he had
developed so belatedly, by which his enemies were all to be confounded; and,
knowing that Lynch would follow wherever he led, Wunpost had made his plans
accordingly. He was leading the way into a trap, long set, which was sure to
enmesh its prey.</p>

<p>At daylight Wunpost paused in his steady, plunging climb and looked back over
the rock-slides and boulders; and while his mules munched their grain well back
out of sight he focussed his new field glasses and watched. From the knife-blade
ridge up which he had spurred and scrambled the whole country lay before him
like a relief map, and in the particular gash-like canyon where he had located
the Stinging Lizard he made out his furtive pursuers. The Indian was ahead,
leaning over in his saddle as he kept his eyes on the trail; and Lynch rode
behind, a heavy rifle beneath his knee, scanning the ridges to prevent a
surprise. But neither led a pack-horse and when Wunpost had looked his fill he
put up his glasses and smiled.</p>

<p>In the country where he was going there was no grass for those horses, no
browse that even an Indian pony could travel on; and if they wanted to keep up
with him and his grain-fed mules they <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_138'></a>138</span>would have to use quirt and spurs. And the man who
feeds his horse on buckskin alone is due to walk back to camp. So reasoned John
C. Calhoun from his cow-puncher days, when he had tried out the weaknesses of
horseflesh; and as he returned to the grassy swale where his mules were hid he
looked them over proudly. His riding mule, Old Walker, was still in his prime, a
big-bellied animal with the long reach in its fore-shoulders which made it by
nature a fast walker; and his pack-mule, equally round-bellied to store away
food, was short-bodied as well so that he bore his pack easily without any
tendency to give down. He had been raised with Old Walker and would follow him
anywhere, without being dragged by a rope, so that Wunpost had both hands for
any emergency which might arise and could keep his eyes on the trail.</p>

<p>And to think that these noble animals, big and black and beautifully gaited,
had been bought with Judson Eells&#8217; own money; while he, poor fool, sent
Lynch out after him on a miserable Indian cayuse. Wunpost&#8217;s road was
always plain, for where he went they must follow, but at every rocky point or
granite-strewn flat they must circle and cut for his trail. As he rode on now to
the north he did not double and twist, for the Indian would know the old trail;
but the tracks he had left behind him before he mounted to the ridge were as
aimless as it was possible to make them. They did not strike out boldly up some
hogback or canyon but at every fork and bend they turned this way and that, as
if he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>were
hopelessly lost. And now as he rode on, unobserved by his pursuers, over the
well-worn Indian trail along the summit, Lynch and his tracker were far behind,
tracing his mule-tracks to and fro, up and down the broiling hot canyons.</p>

<p>On the summit it was cool and the grass was still green, for the snow had
held late on the peaks, and the junipers and piñons had given place to oaks and
limber pines which stood up along the steep slopes like switches. The air was
sweet and pure, all the world lay below him; but, as the heat came on, the abyss
of Death Valley was lost in a pall of black haze. It gathered from nowhere,
smoke-like and yet not smoke; a haze, a murk, a mass of writhing heat like the
fumes from a witches&#8217; cauldron. Wunpost had simmered in that cauldron, and
he would simmer again soon; but gladly, if he had Lynch for company. It was
follow-my-leader and, since there were no long wharves to jump off of, Wunpost
had decided upon the Valley of Death. And if, in following after him to rob him
of his mine, Pisen-face Lynch should succumb to the heat, that might justly be
considered a visitation of Providence to punish him for his misspent life. Or at
least so Wunpost reasoned and, remembering the gun under Lynch&#8217;s knee, he
decided to keep well in the lead.</p>

<p>Wunpost camped that night at the upper water in Wild Rose Canyon, letting his
mules get a last feed of grass; and the next morning at daylight he was up and
away on the long trail that led down to Death Valley. But first it led north
over a broad, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>sandy
plain, where Indian ponies were grazing in stray bands; and then, after ten
miles, it swung off to the east where it broke through the hills and turned
down. After that it was a jump-off for six thousand feet, from the mountain-top
to down below sea-level; and, before he lost himself in the gap between the
hills, Wunpost paused and looked back across the plain.</p>

<p>This was the door to his trap, for at the edge of the rim the trail split in
twain; the Wet Trail leading past water while the Dry Trail was shorter, but
dry. And as live bait is best he unpacked and waited patiently until he spied
his pursuers in the pass. They were not five miles away, coming down the narrow
draw which marked the turn in the trail, and after a long look Wunpost put up
his glasses and saddled and packed to go. Yet still he lingered on, looking back
through the shimmering heat that seemed to make the yellow earth blaze; until at
last they were so near that he could see them point ahead and bring their tired
horses to a stop. Then he whipped out his pistol and shot back at them
defiantly, turning off up the Dry Trail at a trot.</p>

<p>They followed, but cautiously, as if anxious to avoid a conflict and Wunpost
swung off between the points of two hills and led them on down the dry canyon.
If they took the Wet Trail, which the Indian knew, he might double back and give
them the slip; but now there was no water till they had descended to sea level
and crossed the treacherous corduroy to Furnace Creek. The trap was sprung,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>they were committed
to the adventure, to follow him wherever he might lead; and Wunpost never
stopped spurring until he had descended the steep canyon and led them out in the
dry wash below. It was like climbing down a wall into a sink-hole of boiling
heat, but Lynch did not weaken and Wunpost bowed his head and took the main
trail to the ranch.</p>

<p>The sun swung low behind the rim of the Panamints, throwing a shadow across
the broad canyon below; ten miles to the east, under the heat and haze, lay
Furnace Creek Ranch and rest; but as his pursuers came on, just keeping within
sight of him, Wunpost turned off sharply to the north. He quit the trail and
struck out across the boulder-patches towards the point of Tucki Mountain, and
if they followed him there it would be into a country that even the Indians were
afraid of. It was there that Death Valley had earned its name, when a party of
Mormon emigrants had died beside their ox-teams after drinking the water at Salt
Creek. There was Stove-pipe Hole, with the grave close by of the man who had not
stopped to bail the hole; and, nearest of all, was Poison Spring, the worst
water in all Death Valley. Wunpost turned out and started north, daring his
enemies to follow, and Lynch accept the challenge&#8211;alone.</p>

<p>The Indian rode on, leaving the white man to his fate and heading for Furnace
Creek Ranch; and Wunpost, sweating streams and cursing to himself, flogged on
toward Poison Spring. It was a hideous <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_142'></a>142</span>thing to do, but Lynch had chosen to follow him and
his blood would be upon his own head. Wunpost had given him the trail, to go on
to the ranch while he turned back the way they had come; but no, Lynch was
bull-headed, or perhaps the heat had warped his judgment&#8211;in any case he
had elected to follow. The last courtesies were past, Wunpost had given him his
chance, and Lynch had taken his trail like a bloodhound; he could not claim now
that he was going in the same direction&#8211;he was following along after him
like a murderer. Perhaps the slow fever of the terrible heat had turned his
anger into an obsession to kill, for Wunpost himself was beginning to feel the
desert madness and he set out deliberately to lure him.</p>

<p>Where the black and frowning ramparts of Tucki Mountain thrust out towards
the edge of the Sink a spring of stinking water rises up from the ground and
runs off into the marsh. From the peaks above, it is a bright strip of green at
which the wary mountain sheep gaze longingly; but down in that rank grass there
are bones and curling horns that have taught the survivors to beware. It is
Poison Spring, <i>the</i>Poison Spring in a land where all water is bad; and in
many a long day Wunpost was the only human being who had gazed into its crystal
depths. For the water was clear, too clear to be good, without even a green scum
along its edge; and the rank, deceiving grass which grew up below could not
tempt him to more than taste it. But, being trailed at the time by some men from
Nevada who had seen <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_143'></a>143</span> the Sockdolager ore, he had conceived a possible
use for the spring; and, coming back later, he had buried two cans of good water
where he could find them when occasion demanded. This was the trap, in fact,
toward which for four days he had been leading his vindictive pursuers; it was
poisoned bait, laid out by Nature herself, to strike down such coyotes as
Lynch.</p>

<p>Wunpost arrived at Poison Spring well along in the evening, the desert night
being almost turned to day by the splendor of a waning moon. He rode in across
the flat and down the salt-encrusted bank, still sweltering in the smothering
heat; and the pounding blood in his brain had brought on a kind of fury&#8211;a
death-anger at Pisen-face Lynch. He dug into the sand and drew out the cans of
water, holding his mules away from the spring; and then, from a bucket, he gave
each a small drink after taking a large one himself. There were two five-gallon
cans, and after he had finished he lashed the full one on the pack; the other
one, which sloshed faintly if one shook it up and down, he tossed mockingly down
by the spring. And then he rode on, wiping the sweat from his brow and gazing
back grimly into the night.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>WUNPOST TAKES THEM ALL ON</span></h2>

<p>The morning found Wunpost at Salt Creek Crossing, where the bones of a
hundred emigrants lie buried in the sand without even a cross to mark their
resting place. It was a place well calculated to bring up thoughts of death, but
Wunpost faced the coming day calmly. At the first flush of dawn the sand was
still hot from the sun of the evening before; the low air seemed to suffocate
him with its below-sea-level pressure, and the salt marshes to give off stinking
gases; it was a hell-hole, even then, and the day was yet to come, when the
Valley would make life a torment.</p>

<p>The white borax-flats would reflect a blinding light, the briny marshes would
seethe in the sun; and every rock, every sand-dune, would radiate more heat to
add to the flame in the sky. Wunpost knew it well, the long-enduring agony which
would be his lot that day; but he moved about briskly, bailing the slime from
the well and sinking it deeper into the sand. He doused his body into the water
and let his pores drink, and threw buckets of it on his beseeching mules; but
only after the well-hole had been scraped and bailed twice would he permit them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>to drink the
brackish water. Then he tied them in the shade of the wilting mesquite trees and
strode to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>A man, perforce, takes on the color of his surroundings, and Wunpost was
coated white from the crystallized salt and baked black underneath by the glare;
but the look in his eyes was as savage and implacable as that of a devil from
hell. He sat down on the point and focussed his glasses on Poison Spring, and
then on the trail beyond; and at last, out on the marshes, he saw an object that
moved&#8211;it was Pisen-face Lynch and his horse. The horse was in the lead,
picking his way along a trail which led across the Sink towards the Ranch; and
Lynch was behind, following feebly and sinking down, then springing up again and
struggling on. His way led over hummocks of solid salt, across mud-holes and
borax-encrusted flats; and far to the south another form moved towards
him&#8211;it was the Indian, riding out to bring him in.</p>

<p>The sun swung up high, striking through Wunpost&#8217;s thin shirt like the
blast from a furnace door; sweat rolled down his face, to be sopped up by the
bath-towel which he wore draped about his neck; but he sat on his hilltop, grim
as a gargoyle on Notre Dame, gloating down on the suffering man. This was
Pisen-face Lynch, the bad man from Bodie, who was going to trail him to his
mine; this was Eells&#8217; hired man-killer and professional claim-jumper who
had robbed him of the Wunpost and Willie Meena&#8211;and now he was a derelict,
lost on the desert he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_146'></a>146</span>claimed to know, following along behind his
half-dead horse; and but for the Indian who was coming out to meet him he would
go to his just reward. Wunpost put up his glasses and turned back with a
grin&#8211;it was hell, but he was getting his revenge.</p>

<p>Wunpost spent the heat of the day in the bottom of the well, floating about
like a frog in the brine, but as evening came on he crawled out dripping and
saddled up and packed in haste. Every cinch-ring was searing hot, even the wood
and leather burned him, and as he threw on the packs he lifted one foot after
the other in a devil&#8217;s dance over the hot sands. It was hot even for Death
Valley, the hottest place in North America, but there was no use in waiting for
it to cool. Wunpost soused himself and mounted, and the next morning at dawn he
looked down from the rim of the Panamints.</p>

<p>The great sink-hole was beginning to seethe, to give off its poisonous vapors
and fill up like a bowl with its own heat; but he had escaped it and fled to the
heights while Pisen-face Lynch stayed below. He was still at the ranch, gasping
for breath before the water-fan which served to keep the men there alive; and as
he breathed that bone-dry air and felt the day&#8217;s heat coming on, he was
cursing the name of Calhoun. Yes, cursing long and loud, or deep and low, and
vowing to wreak his revenge; for before he had worked for hire, but now he had a
grievance of his own. He would take up Wunpost&#8217;s trail like an Indian on
the warpath, like a warrior who had been robbed of his medicine-bag; he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>come on the run and
with blood in his eye&#8211;that is, if the heat had not killed him. For his
pride was involved, and his name as a trailer and an all-around desert-man; he
had been led into a trap by a boy in his twenties, and it was up to him to
demonstrate or quit.</p>

<p>Wunpost went his way tranquilly, for there was no one to pursue him; and ten
days later he rode down Jail Canyon with his pack-mule loaded with ore. It had
been his boast that he would return in two weeks with a mule-load of Sockdolager
gold; but Billy, as usual, had taken his boast lightly and came running with
news of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; she called. &#8220;Say, you can&#8217;t guess what
I&#8217;ve done&#8211;I&#8217;ve taught Red and Good Luck to be friends. They
eat their supper together!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; observed Wunpost, &#8220;and not to change the subject,
what&#8217;s the chances for a white man to eat? I&#8217;ve been living on jerky
for three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;re good,&#8221; returned Billy, suddenly quieted by
his manner. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&#8211;have you had any
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; blustered Wunpost, &#8220;nah, nothing like
that&#8211;the other fellow had all the trouble. Did Pisen-face Lynch and that
Injun come back? Well, I&#8217;ll bet they were dragging their tracks
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t come through here, but I saw them on the
trail&#8211;it must have been a week ago. But what&#8217;s all that that
you&#8217;ve got in your pack-sacks&#8211;have you been out and got some more
ore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; answered Wunpost, deftly easing <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>off his kyacks and lowering the load to
the ground. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you I was going to get some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; he demanded, looking down on her arrogantly, and
Wilhelmina became interested in the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have such a funny way of talking,&#8221; she said at last,
&#8220;and besides&#8211;would you mind letting me look at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure would!&#8221; replied Wunpost; &#8220;you leave them sacks
alone. And any time my word ain&#8217;t as good as gold&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course it&#8217;s good!&#8221; she protested, and he took her
at her word.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then&#8211;I&#8217;ve got the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have you really?&#8221; she cried, and as he rolled his eyes
accusingly she laughed and bit her lip. &#8220;That&#8217;s just <i>my</i> way of
talking,&#8221; she explained, rather lamely. &#8220;I mean I&#8217;m
glad&#8211;and surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be more surprised,&#8221; he said, nodding grimly,
&#8220;when I show you a piece of the ore. I sold that last lot to a jeweler in
Los Angeles for twenty-four dollars an ounce, quartz and all&#8211;and pure gold
is worth a little over twenty. Talk about your jewelry ore! Wait till I show
this in Blackwater and watch them saloon-bums come through here. Too lazy to go
out and find anything for themselves&#8211;all they know is to follow some poor
guy like me and rob him of what he finds. What&#8217;s the news from down
below?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; answered Billy, and stood watching <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>him doubtfully as he
unsaddled and turned out his gaunted mules. His new black hat was sweated
through already and his clothes were salt-stained and worn, but it was the look
in his eye even more than his clothes which convinced her he had had a hard
trip. He was close-mouthed and grim and the old rollicking smile seemed to have
been lost beneath a two weeks&#8217; growth of beard. Perhaps she had done wrong
to speak of the dog first, but she knew there was something behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have a fight with Mr. Lynch?&#8221; she asked at last, and he
darted a quick glance and said nothing. &#8220;Because when he went through
here,&#8221; she went on finally, &#8220;he seemed to be awful
quarrelsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s quarrelsome,&#8221; admitted Wunpost, &#8220;but so am
I. You wait till I tangle with him, sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hungry!&#8221; she declared, still gazing at him fixedly,
and he gave way to a twisted grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you guess it?&#8221; he inquired; but she did not tell
him, for of course they were supposed to be friends. Yes, good friends, and
more&#8211;she had let him kiss her once, but now he seemed to have forgotten
it. He ate supper greedily and went back to the corral to sleep, and in the
morning he was gone.</p>

<p>The early-risers at Blackwater, out to look for their burros or to get a
little eye-opener at the saloon, were astonished to see his mules in the adobe
corral and Wunpost himself on the street. He was reputed to be in hiding from
Pisen-face Lynch, who <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span>had been inquiring for him for over a week; and the
news was soon passed to Lynch himself, for Blackwater had a grudge against
Wunpost. He had made the town, yes, in a manner of speaking&#8211;for of course
he had discovered the Willie Meena Mine and brought in Eells and the
boomers&#8211;but never to their knowledge had he spoken a good word of them, or
of anything else in town. He came swaggering down their streets as if he owned
the place, or had enough money to buy it&#8211;and besides, he had led them on
two disastrous stampedes in which no one had even located a claim. And the
Stinging Lizard Mine was salted! Hence their haste to tell Lynch and the
malevolent zeal with which they maneuvered to bring them together.</p>

<p>Wunpost was standing before the Express office, waiting for the agent to open
up and receive his ore-sacks for shipment, when he espied his enemy advancing,
closely followed by an expectant crowd. Lynch was still haggard and emaciated
from his hard trip through Death Valley, and his face had the pallor of indoors;
but his small, hateful eyes seemed to burn in their sockets and he walked with
venomous quickness. But Wunpost stood waiting, his head thrust out and his gun
pulled well to the front, and Lynch came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there you are!&#8221; he burst out accusingly, &#8220;you low-down,
poisoning whelp! You poisoned that water, you know you did, and I&#8217;ve a
danged good mind to kill ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop to it!&#8221; invited Wunpost, &#8220;just git them <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>rubbernecks away. I
ain&#8217;t scared of you or nobody!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and the rubbernecks betook themselves away, but Pisen-face Lynch
did not shoot. He stood in the street, shifting his feet uneasily, and Wunpost
opened the vials of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re bad, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he taunted.
&#8220;You&#8217;re so bad your face hurts you, but you can&#8217;t run no
blazer on me. And just because you chased me clean down into Death Valley you
don&#8217;t need to think I&#8217;m afraid. I was just showing you up as a
desert-man, et cetery, but if any man had told me you&#8217;d drink that
poisoned water I&#8217;d&#8217;ve said he was crazy with the heat. You&#8217;re
a lovely looking specimen of humanity! What&#8217;s the
matter&#8211;didn&#8217;t you like them Epsom salts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was arsenic in that water!&#8221; charged Pisen-face fiercely.
&#8220;I had it analyzed&#8211;you were trying to kill me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sure there was arsenic,&#8221; returned Wunpost mockingly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know that rank, fishy smell? But don&#8217;t blame
me&#8211;it was God Almighty that threw the mixture together. And didn&#8217;t I
leave you a drink in that empty can? Well, where is your proper
gratitude?&#8221;</p>

<p>He ogled him sarcastically and Lynch took a step forward, only to halt as
Wunpost stepped to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right!&#8221; threatened Lynch, his voice tremulous
with rage and weakness. &#8220;You wait till I git back my strength. I&#8217;ll
fix you for this, you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_152'></a>152</span>dirty, poisoning coward&#8211;you led me to that
spring on purpose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you followed, you sucker!&#8221; returned Wunpost
insultingly; &#8220;even your Injun had better sense than that. What did you
expect me to do&#8211;leave you a canteen of good water so you could trail me up
and pot me? No, you can consider yourself lucky I didn&#8217;t shoot you like a
dog for following me off the trail. I gave you the road&#8211;what did you want
to follow <i>me</i> for? By grab, it looked danged bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go where I please!&#8221; declared Lynch defiantly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re hiding a mine that belongs to Mr. Eells and my instructions
were to follow you and find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;d followed your instructions,&#8221; returned
Wunpost easily, &#8220;you sure would have found a mine. Do you see these two
bags? Plum full of ore that I dug since I gave you the shake. Go back and report
that to your boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; snarled Lynch, but his eyes were on the
ore-sacks and now they were gleaming with envy. And other eyes also were
suddenly focussed on the gold, at which Wunpost surveyed the crowd
intolerantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a prize bunch of prospectors,&#8221; he announced as from
the housetops. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get out in the hills and rustle?
That&#8217;s the way I got my start. But you Blackwater stiffs want to hang
around town and let somebody else do the work. All you want is a chance to stake
an extension on some <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_153'></a>153</span>big strike, so you can sell it to some promoter from
Los!&#8221;</p>

<p>He grunted contemptuously and picked up the two big sacks while the citizens
of Blackwater sneered back at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, bull!&#8221; scoffed one, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t got no gold! And
if you have, by grab, you stole it. What about the Stinging Lizard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>what</i> about it?&#8221; retorted Wunpost, giving his bags to
the Express agent, &#8220;&#x2500;put down the value on that at seven thousand
dollars.&#8221; This last was aside to the inquiring Express agent, but the
crowd heard it and burst out hooting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven thousands <i>cents</i>!&#8221; yelled a voice; &#8220;you never
<i>saw</i> seven thousand dollars! You&#8217;re a bull-shover and your mine was
salted!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it was salted!&#8221; agreed Wunpost, laughing exultantly,
&#8220;but you Blackwater stiffs will bite at anything. Did <i>I</i> ever claim
it was a mine? I&#8217;m a bull-shover, am I? Well, when did I ever come here
and try to sell somebody a mine? No; I came into town with some Sockdolager ore,
and you dastards all tried to get me drunk; and I finally made a deal with the
barkeep at The Mint to show him the place for a thousand dollar bill. Well,
didn&#8217;t I show him the place&#8211;and didn&#8217;t he come back more than
satisfied with his pockets bursting out with the gold? <i>He</i> never had no
kick&#8211;I met him in Los Angeles and he told me he had sold the rock for
thirteen hundred dollars to a jeweler. But say, my friends, don&#8217;t you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span> think I knew where
he would go to get that thousand dollar bill? Do you think I was so drunk I
expected a barkeeper to have thousand dollar bills in his pocket? No; I knowed
who he would go to, and Eells gave him the bill and a pocket full of Boston
beans; but he lost them on the road, so I brought him down Jail Canyon and
old-scout Lynch here, he followed my tracks!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that wonderful, now? He followed our tracks back and he
found the Stinging Lizard Mine&#8211;and then, of course, he jumped it!
That&#8217;s his job, when he ain&#8217;t licking old Judson Eells&#8217; boots
or framing up some crooked deal with Flappum; and then he went back and told
Eells. And then Eells&#8211;you know him&#8211;being as he&#8217;d stole the
mine from me, like all crooks he thought it was valuable. Was it up to me then
to go to Mr. Eells and tell him that the mine was salted? Would <i>you</i> have
done it&#8211;would <i>anybody</i>? Well, he thought he had me cinched, and I
sold out for twenty thousand dollars. And now, my friend, you said a moment ago
that I&#8217;d never <i>seen</i> seven thousand dollars. All right, I say
<i>you</i> never did! But just, by grab, to show you who&#8217;s four-flushing
I&#8217;ll put you out of your misery&#8211;I&#8217;ll <i>show</i> you seven
thousand, savvy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stuck out his head and gazed insolently into the man&#8217;s face and then
drew out his wad of bills. They were badly sweated, but the numbers were
there&#8211;he peeled off seven bills and waved them airily, then laughed and
shoved them into his overalls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>&#8220;Tuh hell
with you!&#8221; he burst out defiantly, consigning all Blackwater to perdition
with one grand, oratorical flourish. &#8220;You think you&#8217;re so
smart,&#8221; he went on tauntingly, &#8220;now come and trail me to my mine. If
you find it you can have it&#8211;it ain&#8217;t even staked&#8211;but they
ain&#8217;t one of you dares to follow me. I ain&#8217;t afraid of Eells and his
hired yaller dog, and I ain&#8217;t afraid of <i>you</i>! I&#8217;ll take you
<i>all</i> on&#8211;old Eells and all the rest of you&#8211;and I ain&#8217;t
afraid to show you the ore!&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode into the Express office and grabbed up a sack, which he cut open
with a slash of his knife; and then he reached in and took out a great chunk
that bulged and gleamed with gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I four-flushing?&#8221; he inquired, and when no one answered he
grunted and tied up the hole. There was a silence, and the crowd began to filter
away&#8211;all but Lynch, who stood staring like an Indian. Then he too turned
away, his haggard eyes blinking fast, like a woman on the verge of bitter
tears.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>DIVINE PROVIDENCE</span></h2>

<p>The thundercaps were gleaming like silver in the heat when Wunpost rode back
to Jail Canyon; but he came on almost merrily, a sopping bath-towel about his
neck and his shirt pulled out, like a Chinaman&#8217;s. These were the last days
of September when the clouds which had gathered for months at last were giving
down their rain; and the air, now it was humid, seemed to open every pore and
make the sweat run in rivulets. Wunpost perspired, but he was happy, and as he
neared the silent house he whistled shrilly for his dog. Good Luck came out for
a moment, looked down at him reproachfully, and crawled back under the house,
Yes, it was hot in the canyon, for the ridge cut off the wind and the rimrock
reflected yet more heat, but Wunpost was happy through it all. He had told
Blackwater where it could go.</p>

<p>Not Eells and Lynch alone, but the citizens at large, collectively and as
individuals; and he had planted the seeds of envy and rage to rankle in their
hairy breasts. He had shown them his gold, to make them yearn to find it, and
his money to make <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_157'></a>157</span>them envy him his wealth; and then he had left them
to stew in their own juice, for Blackwater was as hot as Jail Canyon. He was
riding a horse now, and, in addition to Old Walker, he had a third mule, heavily
packed; and he was headed for the hills to hide still more food and water
against the chase that was sure to come. Sooner or later they would follow on
his trail, those petty, hateful souls who now sat in the barrooms and gasped
like fish for breath; but they were waiting, forsooth, for the weather to cool
down and the cloudbursts to finish their destruction. And that was the very
reason why they would never find his mine&#8211;they were afraid to take his
chances.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell and Wilhelmina were out on the back porch, which had been
sprinkled until it was almost cool; and when Wunpost had unpacked and put his
mules in the corral he came up the hill and joined them. Wilhelmina had returned
to her proper sphere, being clothed in the filmiest of gowns; and poor Mrs.
Campbell, who was nearly prostrated by the heat, allowed her to entertain the
company. They sat in the dense shade of the umbrella trees and creepers, within
easy reach of a dripping olla; and after taking a huge drink, which started the
sweat again, Wunpost sank down on the cool dirt floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so hot here!&#8221; he began encouragingly; &#8220;you
ought to be down in Blackwater. Say, the wind off that Sink would make your hair
curl. I scared a lizard out of the shade and he hadn&#8217;t run ten feet till
he disappeared in a puff of smoke. His <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_158'></a>158</span>pardner turned over and started to lick his
toes&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does look like rain,&#8221; observed Billy with a twinkle.
&#8220;How long since <i>you</i> started to herd lizards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8211;me?&#8221; inquired Wunpost. &#8220;W&#8217;y, I&#8217;m telling
you the truth. But say, it does look like rain. If they&#8217;d only spread it
out, instead of dumping it all in one place, it&#8217;d suit me better,
personally. There was a cloudburst last week hit into the canyon above me and I
just made my getaway in time, and where that water landed you&#8217;d think a
hydraulic sluice had been washing down the hill for a year. It all struck in one
place and gouged clean down to bedrock, and when she came by me there was so
much brush pushed ahead that it looked like a big, moving dam. Where&#8217;s
your father&#8211;up getting out ore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s up at the mine,&#8221; spoke up Mrs. Campbell,
&#8220;although I&#8217;ve begged him not to work so hard. The heat is almost
killing him, but he&#8217;s so thankful to have his road done that he
won&#8217;t delay a minute. He&#8217;s used up all his sacks, but he&#8217;s
still sorting the ore so that he can load it right onto the trucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; commented Wunpost, glancing furtively
at Billy, &#8220;I hope he makes a million. He deserves it&#8211;he&#8217;s sure
worked hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he has,&#8221; responded Mrs. Campbell, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
always had faith in him, but others have tried to discourage him. I believe
I&#8217;ve heard you say that his work was all wasted, but now everybody is
envying him his success. It all goes to show that the Lord cares for his own,
and that the righteous are <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span>not forgotten; because Cole has always said he would
rather be poor and honest than to own the greatest fortune in the land. And now
it seems as if the hand of Providence has just reached down and given us our
road&#8211;the Lord provides for his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks that way,&#8221; agreed Wunpost; &#8220;sure treating
<i>me</i> fine, too. There was a time, back there, when He seemed to have a
copper on every bet I played, but now luck is coming my way. Of course I
don&#8217;t deserve it&#8211;and for that matter, I don&#8217;t ask no
odds&#8211;but this last mine I found is a Sockdolager right, and Eells or none
of &#8217;em can&#8217;t find it. I took down one mule-load that was worth ten
thousand dollars, and when I was shipping it you should have seen them
Blackwater bums looking on with tears in their eyes. That&#8217;s all right
about the Lord providing for his own, but I tell you hard work has got something
to do with it, whether you believe in religion or not. I&#8217;m a rustler,
I&#8217;ll say that, and I work for what I get, just as hard as your husband or
anyone&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but Mister Calhoun,&#8221; broke in Mrs. Campbell reproachfully,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve heard evil stories of your dealings with Eells. Not that we
like him, for we don&#8217;t; but, so we are informed, the mine that you sold
him was salted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother!&#8221; exclaimed Billy, but the fat was in the fire, for
Wunpost had nodded shamelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the mine was salted, but don&#8217;t let
that keep you awake nights. I didn&#8217;t <i>sell</i> him the mine&#8211;he took
it away from me and gave me twenty thousand for a quit-claim. And the twenty
thousand <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> dollars
was nothing to what I lost when he robbed me and Billy of our mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, Mr. Calhoun!&#8221; cried Mrs. Campbell in a shocked
voice, &#8220;did you salt that mine on purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have thought so,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;if you&#8217;d
seen me packing the ore. It took me nigh onto two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell paused and gasped, but Wunpost met her gaze with a cold,
unblinking stare. Her nice Scotch scruples were not for such as he, and if she
crowded him too far he had an answer to her reproaches which would effectually
reduce her to silence. But Billy knew that answer, and the reason for the gleam
which played like heat-lightning in his eyes, and she hastened to stave off
disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; she protested, &#8220;now please don&#8217;t talk
seriously to him or he&#8217;ll confess to almost anything. He told me a lot of
stuff and I was dreadfully worried about it, but I found out he only did it to
tease me. And besides, you know yourself that Mr. Eells did take advantage of us
and trick us out of our mine&#8211;and if it hadn&#8217;t been for that we could
have built the road ourselves without being beholden to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Billy, child!&#8221; she chided, &#8220;just think what
you&#8217;re saying. Is it any excuse that others are dishonest? Well, I must
say I&#8217;m surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re surprised, are you?&#8221; spoke up Wunpost, rising
ponderously to his feet. &#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t like my style, just say
so.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>He reached for
his hat and stood waiting for the answer, but Mrs. Campbell avoided the
issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for us to judge our neighbors&#8211;the Bible says: Judge
not, lest ye be judged&#8211;but I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Calhoun, that you think so
poorly of us as to boast of the deception you practised. He&#8217;s no friend of
us, this Judson Eells, but surely you cannot think it was aught but dishonest to
sell him a salted mine. Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and because he took
your property is no excuse for committing a crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>crime</i>!&#8221; repeated Wunpost, and turned to look at Billy,
who hung her head regretfully. &#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;She says I&#8217;m a criminal! Well, I won&#8217;t bother you folks any
more. But before I go, Mrs. Campbell, I might as well tell you that these
criminals sometimes come in danged handy. Suppose I&#8217;d buried that ore in
Happy Canyon, for instance, or over the summit in Hanaupah&#8211;where would the
Campbell family be for a road? They wouldn&#8217;t have one, <i>would</i> they?
And this here Providence that you talk about would be distributing its rewards
to others. But there&#8217;s too many good people for the rewards to go
around&#8211;that&#8217;s why some of us get out and rustle. No, you want to be
thankful that a criminal came along and took a flyer at being Providence
himself; otherwise you&#8217;d be stuck with your mine on your
hands&#8211;because I gave you that road, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started for the door and Mrs. Campbell let him go, for the revelation had
left her thunderstruck. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_162'></a>162</span>Never for a moment had she doubted that the sterling
integrity of her husband had brought a special dispensation of Providence, and
while her faith in Divine Providence was by no means shaken, she did begin to
doubt the miracle. Perhaps, after all, this loud and boastful Wunpost had been
more than an instrument of Providence&#8211;he might, in fact, have been a
kindly but misguided friend, who had shaped his vengeance to serve their special
needs. For he knew they needed the road and, since he could salt a crevice
anywhere, he had located his mine up their canyon. And then Eells had jumped the
mine and built the road, and&#x2500;Well, really, after all, it was no more than
right to go out and thank him for his kindness. He was wrong, of course, and led
astray by angry passions; but Wilhelmina and he were friends and&#x2500;She rose
up and hurried out after him.</p>

<p>The blazing light in the heavens almost blinded her sight as she stepped out
into the sun; and high up above the peaks, like cones of burnished metal, she
saw two thundercaps, turning black at the base and mounting on the superheated
air. There was the hush in the air which she had learned to associate with an
explosion such as was about to take place, and she looked back anxiously, for
her husband was up the canyon and the downpour might strike above Panamint. It
was clouds such as these that had come together before to form the cloudburst
which had isolated their mine, and though they now appeared daily she could
never escape the fear that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_163'></a>163</span>once more they would send down their floods. Every
day they struck somewhere, and one more bone-dry canyon ran bank-high and spewed
its refuse across the plain, and each time she had the feeling that their sins
might be punished by another visitation from on high. But she only glanced back
once, for Wunpost was packing and Billy was looking on hopelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Calhoun!&#8221; she called, &#8220;please don&#8217;t go up
the canyon now&#8211;there&#8217;s a cloudburst forming above the
peaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; he grumbled, cocking his eye at the
clouds&#8211;and then he stopped and looked again. &#8220;There went
lightning,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that&#8217;s a mighty bad
sign&#8211;they&#8217;re stabbing out towards each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d better stay,&#8221; she went on
apologetically, &#8220;and please don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re not welcome.
But oh! this heat is terrible&#8211;I&#8217;ll have to go back&#8211;but Billy
will stop and help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her sunshade as if she were fleeing from a rain-storm and hastened
back out of the sun; and Wunpost, after a minute of careful scrutiny, unpacked
and squatted down in the shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re moving together,&#8221; he said to Billy, &#8220;and see
that lightning reaching out? This is going to bust the world open, somewhere.
That&#8217;s no cloudburst that&#8217;s shaping up, it&#8217;s a regular old
waterspout; I know by the way she acts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He settled back on his heels to await the outcome, and as the thunder began
to roll he turned to his companion and shook his head in ominous silence. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>There were but two clouds
in the sky, all the rest was blazing light; and these two clouds were moving
slowly together, or rather, towards a common center. One came on from the
southeast, the other from the west, and some invisible force seemed to be
drawing them towards the peaks which marked the summit of the Panamints. The
play of the lightning became almost constant, the rumbling rose to a tumult; and
then, as if caught by resistless hands, the two clouds rushed together. There
was a flash of white light, a sudden blackening of the mass, and as Wunpost
leapt up shouting a writhing funnel reached down as if feeling for the
palpitating earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she goes!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;it&#8217;s a waterspout, all
right&#8211;but it ain&#8217;t going to land near here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He talked on, half to himself, as the great spiral reached and lengthened;
and then he shouted again, for it had struck the ground, though where it was
impossible to tell. The high rim of the canyon cut off all but the high peaks,
and they could see nothing but the waterspout now; and it, as if stabilized by
its contact with the earth, had turned into a long line of black. It was a
column of falling water, and the two clouds, which had joined, seemed to be
discharging their contents down a hole. They were sucked into the vortex, now
turned an inky black, and their millions of tons of water were precipitated upon
one spot, while all about the ground was left dry.</p>

<p>Wunpost knew what was happening, for he had seen it once before, and as he
watched the rain <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_165'></a>165</span>descend he imagined the spot where it fell and the
wreck which would follow its flood. For the Panamints are set on edge and shed
rain like a roof, the water all flowing off at once; and when they strike a
canyon, after rushing down the converging gulches, there is nothing that can
withstand their violence. Every canyon in the range, and in the Funeral Range
beyond, and in Tin Mountain and the Grapevines to the north&#8211;every one of
them had been swept by the floods from the heights and ripped out as clean as a
sand-wash. And this waterspout, which had turned into a mighty cloudburst, would
sweep one of them clean again. The question was&#8211;which one?</p>

<p>A breeze, rising suddenly, came up from the Sink and was sucked into the
vortex above; the black line of the downfall turned lead-color and broadened out
until it merged into the clouds above; and at last, as Wunpost lingered, the
storm disappeared and the canyon took on the hush of heavy waiting. The sun
blazed out as before, the fig-leaves hung down wilted; but the humidity was gone
and the dry, oven-heat almost created the illusion of coolness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; announced Wunpost, for the third or
fourth time. &#8220;She must have come down away north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;wait!&#8221; protested Billy, &#8220;why are you always in
such a hurry? And perhaps the flood hasn&#8217;t come yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be here,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;been an hour, by my
watch; and believe me, that old boy would be coming <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>some. Excuse <i>me</i>, if it should hit
into one end of a box canyon while I was coming up the other. My friends could
omit the flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why not stay, then?&#8221; she pouted anxiously; &#8220;you know
Mother didn&#8217;t mean anything. And perhaps Father will be down, to see if
there was any damage done, and we could catch him first and explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No explaining for me!&#8221; returned Wunpost, beginning to pack;
&#8220;you can tell them whatever you want. And if your folks are too religious
to use my old road maybe the Lord will send a cloudburst and destroy it.
That&#8217;s the way He always did in them old Bible stories&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughten to talk that way!&#8221; warned Wilhelmina soberly,
&#8220;and besides, that&#8217;s what made Mother angry. She isn&#8217;t feeling
well, and when you spoke slightingly of Divine Providence&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; he said again, &#8220;before I begin to
quarrel with <i>you</i>. But, oh say, I want to get that dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s too hot!&#8221; she protested, &#8220;let him stay
under the house. He and Red are sleeping there together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I need him,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;liable to be bushwhacked
now, any time; and I want a dog to guard camp at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started towards the house, still looking up the canyon, and at the gate he
stopped dead and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked, and glanced about wildly, but
Billy only shook her head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t hear anything,&#8221; she replied, turning listlessly away,
&#8220;but I wish you wouldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe I won&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered grimly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you hear that kind of rumble, up the canyon?&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened again, then rushed towards the house while Wunpost made a dash
for the corral. The cloudburst was coming down their canyon.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ANSWER</span></h2>

<p>The rumbling up the canyon was hardly a noise; it was a tremulous shudder of
earth and air like the grinding that accompanies an earthquake. But Wunpost
knew, and the Campbells knew, what it meant and what was to follow; and as it
increased to a growl they threw down the corral bars and rushed the stock up to
the high ground. They waited, and Wunpost ran back to get his dog, and then the
dammed waters broke loose. A great spray of yellow mud splashed out from
Corkscrew Gorge and a piñon-trunk was snapped high into the air; and while all
the earth trembled the dam of mud burst forth, forced on by the weight of
backed-up waters. Then more trees came smashing through, followed by muddy tides
of driftwood, and as suddenly the debacle ceased.</p>

<p>There was quiet, except for the hoarse rumble of boulders as they ground
their way down through the Gorge; and for the muffled crack of submerged
tree-trunks, straining and breaking beneath the ever-mounting jamb. It rose up
and overflowed in a gush of turbid waters, rose still higher and overflowed
again; and then it broke loose in a crash like imminent <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>thunder&#8211;the cloudburst had
conquered the Gorge. It went through it and over it, spreading out on its
sloping sides; and when the worst crush seemed over it washed higher yet and
came through with an all-devouring surge. In a flash the whole creekbed was a
mass of mud and driftwood, which swashed about and swayed drunkenly on; and, as
great tree-boles came battering through, the jamb broke abruptly and spewed out
a sea of yellow water.</p>

<p>The fugitives climbed up higher, followed by the cat and dog, and the burros
which had been left in the corrals; but the flood bore swiftly on, leaving the
ranch unsullied by its burden of brush and mud. The jamb broke down again,
letting out a second gush of water which crept up among the lower trees, but
just as the Gorge opened up for the third time the flood-crest struck the lower
gorge and stopped. Once more the trees and logs which had formed the jamb above
bobbed and floated on the surface of a pond; and while the Campbells gazed and
wept the turbid flood swung back swiftly, inundating their ranch with its
mud.</p>

<p>First the orchard was overflowed, then the garden above the road, then the
corrals and the flowers by the gate; and as they ran about distracted the water
crept up towards the house and out over the verdant alfalfa. But just when it
seemed as if the whole ranch would be destroyed there was a smash from the lower
point; the jamb went out, draining the waters quickly away and rushing on
towards the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>Sink.
The great mass of mud and boulders which had been brought down by the flood
ceased to spread out and cover their fields, and as the millrace of waters
continued to pour down the canyon it began to dig a new streambed in the débris.
Then the thunder of its roaring subsided by degrees and by sundown the
cloudburst was past.</p>

<p>Where the creek had been before there was a wider and deeper creek, its sides
cumbered with huge boulders and tree-trunks; and the mixture of silt and gravel
which formed its cut banks already had set like cement. It <i>was</i> cement, the
same natural concrete which Nature combines everywhere on the
desert&#8211;gravel and lime and bone-dry clay, sluiced and mixed by the passing
cloudburst and piled up to set into pudding-stone. And all the mud which had
overlaid the garden and orchard was setting like a concrete pavement. The
ancient figs and peach-trees, half buried in the slime, rose up stiffly from the
fertile soil beneath; and the Jail Canyon Ranch, once so flamboyantly green, was
now shore-lined with a blotch of dirty gray. Only the alfalfa patch remained,
and the house on the hill&#8211;everything else was either washed away or
covered with gravel and dirt. And the road&#8211;it was washed away too.</p>

<p>Wunpost worked late and hard, shoveling the muck away from the trees and
clearing a section of the corral; but not until Cole Campbell came down the next
day was the Stinging Lizard road even mentioned. It was gone, they all knew
that, and all their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_171'></a>171</span>prayers and tears could not bring back one rock from
its grade; and yet somehow Wunpost felt guilty, as if his impious words had
brought down this disaster upon his friends. He rushed feverishly about in the
blazing sun, trying to undo the most imminent damage; and Billy and Mrs.
Campbell, half divining his futile regrets, went about their own tasks in
silence. But when Campbell came down over the mountain-sheep trail and beheld
what the cloudburst had done he spoke what came first into his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my road,&#8221; he moaned, talking half to himself after the
manner of the lonely and deaf, &#8220;and I let it lie idle six weeks! All my
ore still sacked and waiting on the dump, and now my road is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed his head and gave way to tears, for he had lost ten years&#8217;
work in a day, and then Mrs. Campbell forgot. She had remained silent before,
not wishing to seem unkind, but now she spoke from her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a visitation!&#8221; she wailed; &#8220;the Lord has
punished us for our sins. We should never have used the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; demanded Campbell, rousing up from his brooding,
and he saw Wunpost turning guiltily away. &#8220;Ah, I knew it!&#8221; he burst
out; &#8220;I misdoubted it all the time, but you thought you could keep it from
me. But when I came down from Panamint, to see where the waterspout had struck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>and found it
tearing in from Woodpecker Canyon, I said: &#8216;It is the hand of God!&#8217; We had
not come by our road quite honestly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; sobbed Mrs. Campbell, &#8220;and I hate to say it, but
I&#8217;m glad the road is destroyed. What you built we came by honestly, but
the rest was obtained by fraud, and now it has all been destroyed. You have
worked long and hard, Cole, and I&#8217;m sorry this had to happen; but God is
not mocked, we know that. I tried to keep it from you, and to keep myself from
knowing; but he told me himself that he salted the mine on purpose, so that
Eells would build us a road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; nodded Campbell, and looked out from under his eyebrows at
the man who had befriended him by fraud. But he was a man of few words, and his
silence spoke for him&#8211;Wunpost scuffled his feet and withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m going,&#8221; he announced to Billy as he threw on his
packs; &#8220;this is getting too rough for me. So I crabbed the whole play, eh,
and fetched that cloudburst down Woodpecker? And it washed out your
father&#8217;s road! It&#8217;s a wonder Divine Providence didn&#8217;t ketch
<i>me</i> up the canyon, and wipe me off the footstool, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps He spared you,&#8221; suggested Billy, whose eyes were big
with awe, &#8220;so you could repent and be forgiven of your sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet ye!&#8221; scoffed Wunpost; &#8220;but you can&#8217;t tell
<i>me</i> that God Almighty was steering that waterspout. It just hit in
Woodpecker Canyon, same as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_173'></a>173</span> one hit Hanaupah last week and another one washed
out down below. They&#8217;re falling every day, but I&#8217;m going up into
them hills, and do you reckon one will drop on me? Don&#8217;t you think
it&#8211;God Almighty has got more important business than following me around
through the hills. I&#8217;m going to take my little dog, so I&#8217;ll be sure
to have Good Luck; and if I don&#8217;t come back you&#8217;ll know somebody has
got me, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tightened his lash ropes viciously, mounted his horse and took the lead,
followed by Old Walker and the other mules, packed; and when he whistled for
Good Luck, to Billy&#8217;s surprise the little terrier went bounding off after
him. She waved at him furtively and tried to toll him back, but his devotion to
his master was still just as strong as it had been when he had adopted him in
Los Angeles. When he had been prostrated by the heat he had stayed with Billy
gladly, but now that he was strong and accustomed to the climate he raced along
after the mules. Wunpost looked back and grinned, then he reached down a hand
and swooped his dog up into the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t steal him!&#8221; he hooted, and Billy bit her lip,
for she thought she had weaned him from his master. And Wunpost&#8211;she had
thought he was tamed to her hand, but he too had gone off and left her. He was
still as wild and ruthless as on the day they had first met, when he had been
chasing Dusty Rhodes with a stone; and now he was heading off into the high
places he was so fond of, to play hide-and-seek with his pursuers. Several had
come up <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>already,
ostensibly to view the ruin but undoubtedly to keep Wunpost in sight; and if he
continued his lawless strife she doubted if the good Lord would preserve him, as
He had from the cloudburst.</p>

<p>Time and again he had mounted to go and each time she had held him back, for
she had sensed some imminent disaster; and now, as he rode off, she felt the
prompting again to run after him and call him back. But he would not come back,
he was headstrong and unrepentant, making light of what others held sacred; and
as she watched him out of sight something told her again that he was going out
to meet his doom. Some great punishment was hanging over him, to chastise him
for his sins and bring him, perhaps, to repentance; but she could no more stop
his going, or turn him aside from his purpose, than she could control the rush
of a cloudburst. He was like a force of nature&#8211;a rude, fighting creature
who beat down opposition as the flood struck down bushes, rushing on to seek new
worlds to conquer.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A LESSON</span></h2>

<p>The heat-wave, which had made even the desert-dwellers pant, came to an end
with the Jail Canyon waterspout; the nights became bearable, the rocks cooled
off and the sun ceased to strike through men&#8217;s clothes. But there was one,
still clinging to her faded bib-overalls, who took no joy in the blessed
release. Wilhelmina was worried, for the sightseers from Blackwater had
disappeared as soon as Wunpost rode away; and now, two days later, his dog had
come back, meeching and whining and licking its feet. Good Luck had left Wunpost
and returned to the ranch, where he was sure of food and a friend; but now that
he was fed he begged and whimpered uneasily and watched every move that she
made. And every time that she started towards the trail where Wunpost had ridden
away he barked and ran eagerly ahead. Billy stood it until noon, then she caught
up Tellurium and rode off after the dog.</p>

<p>He led up the trail, where he had run so often before, but over the ridge he
turned abruptly downhill and Billy refused to follow. Wunpost certainly had
taken the upper trail, for there were his tracks <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>leading on; and the dog, after all, had
no notion of leading her to his master. He was still young and inexperienced,
though with that thoroughbred smartness which set him apart from the ordinary
cur; but when she made as though to follow he cut circles with delight and ran
along enticingly in front of her. So Billy rode after him, and at the foot of
the hill she found mule-tracks heading off north. Wunpost had made a wide detour
and come back, probably at night, to throw off his pursuers and start fresh; but
as she followed the tracks she found where several horse tracks had circled and
cut into his trail. She picked up Good Luck, who was beginning to get footsore,
and followed the mule-tracks at a lope.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the canyon they struck out over the mud, which the
cloudburst had spread out for miles, but now they were across and going down the
slope which a thousand previous floods had laid. Ahead lay Warm Springs, where
the Indians sometimes camped; but the trail cut out around them and headed for
Fall Canyon, the next big valley to the north. She rode on steadily, her big
pistol that Wunpost had once borrowed now back in its accustomed place; and the
fact that she had failed to tell her parents of her intentions did not keep her
from taking up the hunt. Wunpost was in trouble, and she knew it; and now she
was on her way, either to find him or to make sure he was safe.</p>

<p>The trail up Fall Canyon twists and winds among wash boulders, over cut-banks
and up sandy gulches; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_177'></a>177</span>but at the mouth of the canyon it plunges abruptly
into willow-brush and leads on up the bed of a dry creek. Once more the steep
ridges closed in and made deep gorges, the hillsides were striped with blues and
reds; and along the ancient trail there were tunnels and dumps of rock where
prospectors had dug in for gold. There were dog tracks in the mud showing where
Good Luck had come down, and she knew Wunpost must be up there somewhere; but
when she came upon a mule, lying down under his pack, she started and clutched
at her gun. The mule jumped up noisily and ran smashing through the willows,
then turned with a terrifying snort; and as she drew rein and stopped Good Luck
sprang to the ground and rushed silently off up the canyon.</p>

<p>Billy followed along cautiously, driving the snorting mule before her and
looking for something she feared to find. A buzzard rose up slowly, flopping
awkwardly to clear the canyon wall, and her heart leapt once and stood still.
There in the open lay Wunpost&#8217;s horse, its sharp-shod feet in the air, and
there was a bullet-hole through its side. She stopped and looked about, at the
ridge, at the sky, at the knife-like gash ahead; and then she set her teeth and
spurred up the canyon to where the dog had set up a yapping.</p>

<p>He was standing by a tunnel at the edge of the creek, wagging his tail and
waiting expectantly; and when she came in sight he dashed half-way to meet her
and turned back to the hole in the hill. She rode up to its mouth, her eyes
straining into the darkness, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_178'></a>178</span>her breath coming in short, quick gasps; and
Tellurium, advancing slowly, suddenly flew back and snorted as a voice came out
from the depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; it hailed; &#8220;say, bring me a drink of water.
This is Calhoun&#8211;I&#8217;m shot in the leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are you hiding in there for?&#8221; burst out Billy as she
dismounted; &#8220;why don&#8217;t you crawl out and get some
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that she knew he was alive a swift impatience swept over her, an
unreasoning anger that he had caused her such a fright, and as she unslung her
canteen and started for the tunnel her stride was almost vixenish. But when she
found him stretched out on the bare, uneven rocks with one bloody leg done up in
bandages, she knelt down suddenly and held out the canteen, which he seized and
almost drained at one drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! Fine!&#8221; he smacked; &#8220;began to think you wasn&#8217;t
coming&#8211;did you bring along that medicine I wrote for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what medicine?&#8221; exclaimed Billy. &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t
find a note&#8211;Good Luck must have lost it on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; he said; &#8220;just catch one of my mules
and we&#8217;ll go back to the ranch after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who shot you?&#8221; clamored Billy, &#8220;and what are you in
here for? We&#8217;ll start back home right now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No we won&#8217;t!&#8221; he vetoed; &#8220;there&#8217;s some Injuns
up above there and they&#8217;re doing their best to git me. You can&#8217;t see
&#8217;em&#8211;they&#8217;re hid&#8211;but when I showed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>myself this noon some dastard took a
crack at me with his Winchester. Did you happen to bring along a little
grub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; assented Billy, and went out in a kind of
trance&#8211;it was so unreasonable, so utterly absurd. Why should Indians be
watching to shoot down Wunpost when he had always been friendly with them all?
And for that matter, why should anyone desire to kill him&#8211;that certainly
could never lead them to his mine. The men who had come to the ranch were
Blackwater prospectors&#8211;she knew them all by sight&#8211;and if it was they
who had followed him she was absolutely sure that Wunpost had started the fight.
She stepped out into the dazzling sunshine and looked up at the ridges that rose
tier by tier above her, but she had no fear either of white men or Indians, for
she had done nothing to make them her enemies. Whoever they were, she knew she
was safe&#8211;but Wunpost was hiding in a cave. All his bravado gone, he was
afraid to venture out even to wet his parched throat at the creek.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing?&#8221; she demanded when she had given him her
lunch, and Wunpost reared up at the challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was riding along that trail,&#8221; he answered defiantly,
&#8220;and I wasn&#8217;t doing a thing. And then a bullet came down and got me
through the leg&#8211;I didn&#8217;t even hear the shot. All I know is I was
riding and the next thing I knew I was down and my horse was laying on my leg. I
got out from under him somehow and jumped over into the brush, and I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>been hiding here
ever since. But it&#8217;s Lynch that&#8217;s behind it&#8211;I know that for a
certainty&#8211;he&#8217;s hired some of these Injuns to bushwhack
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen them?&#8221; she asked unbelievingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and I don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I guess I
know Injuns by this time. That&#8217;s just the way they work&#8211;hide out on
some ridge and pot a man when he goes by. But they&#8217;re up there, I know it,
because one of them took a shot at me this noon&#8211;and anyhow I can just
<i>feel</i>&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> can&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Billy, &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re there; and if they are they won&#8217;t hurt
me. They all know me too well, and we&#8217;ve always been good to them.
I&#8217;m going up to catch your mules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, look out!&#8221; warned Wunpost; &#8220;them devils are
treacherous, and I wouldn&#8217;t put it past &#8217;em to shoot you. But you
wait till I get this leg of mine fixed and I&#8217;ll make some of &#8217;em
hard to ketch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see what you get,&#8221; burst out Billy heartlessly,
&#8220;for taking Mr. Lynch to Poison Spring. I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re shot,
but when you get well I hope this will be a lesson to you. Because if it
wasn&#8217;t for your dog, and me running away from home, you never would get
away from here alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for cripes&#8217; sake!&#8221; roared Wunpost,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think I know that now? What&#8217;s the use of rubbing it
in? And you&#8217;re dead right it&#8217;ll be a lesson&#8211;I&#8217;ll ride
the ridges, after this, and the next time I&#8217;ll try to shoot first. But you
go up the canyon and throw the packs off them mules and bring me Old <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>Walker to ride. I
ain&#8217;t crippled; I&#8217;m all right, but this leg is sure hurting me and I
believe I&#8217;ll take a chance. Saddle him up and we&#8217;ll start for the
ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy stepped out briskly, half smiling at his rage and at the straits to
which his anger had brought him; but when she heard his heavy groaning as she
helped him into the saddle her woman&#8217;s heart was touched. After all he was
just a child, a big reckless boy, still learning the hard lessons of life; and
it had certainly been treacherous for the assassin to shoot him without even
giving him a chance. She rode close beside him as they went down the canyon, to
protect him from possible bullets; and if Wunpost divined her purpose it did not
prevent him from keeping her between him and the ridge. The wound and the long
wait had shattered his nerves and made him weak and querulous, and he cursed
softly whenever he hit his sore leg; but back at the ranch his spirits revived
and he insisted upon going on to Blackwater.</p>

<p>Cole Campbell had cleaned his wound and drenched it well with dilute
carbolic, but though it was clean and would heal in a few days, Wunpost demanded
to be taken to town. He was restless and uneasy in the presence of these people,
whose standards were so different from his own; but behind it all there was some
hidden purpose which urged him on to Los Angeles. It was shown in the set lips,
the stern brooding stare and his impatience with his motion-impeding leg; but to
Billy it was shown <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_182'></a>182</span>most by his oblivious glances and the absence of all
proper gratitude. She had done a brave deed in following his dog back and in
rescuing him from the bullets of his enemies, but when she drew near and tried
to engage him in conversation his answers were mostly in monosyllables. Only
once did he rouse up, and that was when she said that Lynch was even with him
now, and the look in his eyes gave Billy to understand that he was not even with
Lynch. That was it&#8211;he was unrepentant, he was brooding revenge, he was
planning even more desperate deeds; but he would not tell her, or even admit
that he was worried about anything but his leg. It was hurting him, he said, and
he wanted a good doctor to see it before it grew worse; but when he went away he
avoided her eye and Billy ran off and wept.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>TAINTED MONEY</span></h2>

<p>A month passed by and the haze above the Sink lifted its shroud and revealed
the mountains beyond; the soft blues and pinks crept back into the distance and
the shadowy canyons were filled with royal purple. At dawn a silver radiance
rose and glowed along the east and the sunsets stained the west with orange and
gold; there was wine in the cool air, and when the night wind came up the
prospectors crouched over their fires. The first October storm put a crown on
Telescope Peak and tipped the lesser Panamints with snow, but still Wilhelmina
waited and Wunpost did not return from his mysterious trip
&#8220;inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time was not ripe for his notable revenge and he had forgotten Jail
Canyon and her. Yet at last she saw his dust, and as she watched him through her
glasses something told her that his thoughts were not of her. He was on his way,
either seeking after gold or searching out the means of revenge; and if he came
that way it was to find his dog and mules and not to make love to her. Their
ranch was merely his half-way house, a place to feed his <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>animals and leave them when he went
away; and she was only a child, to be noticed like a fond dog, but not to be
taken seriously. Billy put up her glasses and went back to the house, and when
he arrived she was a woman. Her hair was done up gracefully, her nimble limbs
were confined in skirts; and she smiled at him demurely, as if her mind was far
away and he had recalled her from maidenly dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost as he limped up to the house and
discovered her on the shady front porch; &#8220;where&#8217;s the trusty
bib-overalls and all? What&#8217;s the matter&#8211;is it Sunday, or did you see
my dust? Say, you don&#8217;t look right without them curls!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thinking of moving away,&#8221; she explained quite
truthfully, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t wear overalls then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moving away!&#8221; cried Wunpost; &#8220;why, where were you thinking
of going to? Has your father given up on his road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no&#8211;or that is, he&#8217;s working on a trail to pack down
the ore he had sacked. And after that&#8217;s shipped, if it pays him what it
ought, we&#8217;re going to move inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; observed Wunpost and sat down on the porch, where he
rumpled his hair reflectively. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he said at last,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a little roll&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter if
<i>I</i> build the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh!&#8221; she hissed, moving over and speaking low;
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know that Mother wouldn&#8217;t hear to it? And poor
Father, he feels awful bad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>&#8220;No, but
look,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;you folks have been my friends, and I owe you
for taking care of my mules. I&#8217;d be glad to advance the money to put in an
aerial tramway and you could pay it back out of the ore. That&#8217;s the kind
of road you want, one that will never wash out, and I know where you can get one
cheap. There&#8217;s one down by Goler that you can buy for almost
nothing&#8211;I stopped and looked it over, coming up. And all you have to do,
after you once get it installed, is to feed your ore into the buckets and send
them down the canyon and the empties will come up with your supplies. It&#8217;s
automatic&#8211;works itself, and can&#8217;t get out of order&#8211;just a
long, double cable, swinging down from point to point and supplying its own
power by gravity. Some class to that, and I tell you what I&#8217;ll
do&#8211;I&#8217;ll lend the money to <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said as he reached down into his pocket, and she gazed
at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked after a minute of puzzled silence,
and she shook her head and pointed towards the house. Then she rose up quietly
and led off down the path where the hollyhocks were still in full bloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; she said at the gate; &#8220;have you
forgotten about the cloudburst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean to
say&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;they think your money is
accursed. Father says you didn&#8217;t come by it honestly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>&#8220;Oh, he
does, eh?&#8221; sulked Wunpost; &#8220;and what do you think about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the same,&#8221; she answered promptly and looked him straight
in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he began with a sardonic smile, and then he thrust
out his lip. &#8220;All right, kid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;excuse me for living,
but I wouldn&#8217;t be that good if I could. It takes all the roar out of life.
Now here I came back with some money in my pocket, to make you a little present,
and the first thing you hand me is this: &#8216;My money ain&#8217;t come by
honestly.&#8217; Well, that&#8217;s the end of the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and waited, but Billy made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went up into the hills,&#8221; he went on at last, &#8220;and
discovered a vein of gold&#8211;nobody had ever owned it before. And I dug it
out and showed the ore to Eells and asked him if he thought it was his. No, he
said he couldn&#8217;t claim it. Well, I took it to Los Angeles and sold it to a
jeweler and here&#8217;s the money he paid me for it&#8211;don&#8217;t you think
that money is honest?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out a sheaf of bills and flicked the ends temptingly, but Billy shook
her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because you don&#8217;t dare to show the
place where you claim you dug up that gold&#8211;and you told Mr. Eells you
<i>stole</i> it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heh, heh!&#8221; chuckled Wunpost, &#8220;you keep right up with me,
kid. Don&#8217;t reckon I can give you any present. I was just thinking you
might like to take a trip to Los Angeles, and see the bright lights and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>all&#8211;taking your
mother along, and so forth&#8211;but it&#8217;s Jail Canyon for you, for life.
If this thousand dollar bill that you earned by saving my life is nothing but
tainted money, all I can do is to tender a vote of thanks. It must be fierce to
have a Scotch conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mind your own business,&#8221; answered Billy shortly, and brushed
away a furtive tear. A trip to Los Angeles&#8211;and new clothes and
everything&#8211;and she really had earned the money! Yes, she had saved his
life and enabled him to come back to dig up some more hidden gold. But it was
stolen, and there was an end to it&#8211;she turned away abruptly, but he caught
her by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, listen, kid,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I may not be an angel, but I
never go back on a friend. Now you tell me what you want and, no matter what it
is, I&#8217;ll go out and get it for you&#8211;honestly. You&#8217;re the best
friend I&#8217;ve got&#8211;and you sure look swell, dressed up in them
women&#8217;s clothes&#8211;but I want you to have a good time. I want you to go
inside and see the world, and go to the theaters and all, but how&#8217;m I
going to slip you the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy laughed, rather hysterically, and then she turned grave and her eyes
looked far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;is a road up
Father&#8217;s canyon&#8211;and I know he won&#8217;t accept it from you. So
let&#8217;s talk about something else. Are you going back to your
mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed, then glanced up at the ridge and nodded his head mysteriously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s somebody after me,&#8221; he
said at last. &#8220;They follow me up now, every place. In town it&#8217;s
detectives, and out here on the desert it&#8217;s Pisen-face Lynch and his gang.
But I don&#8217;t mind them&#8211;I&#8217;m looking for that feller that shot me
in the leg last month. It wasn&#8217;t Lynch&#8211;I&#8217;ve had him
traced&#8211;and it wasn&#8217;t none of those Shooshonnies; but there&#8217;s
some feller in these hills that&#8217;s out after my scalp and I&#8217;ve come
back to get him. And when I find him, kid, I&#8217;ll light a fire under him
that&#8217;ll burn &#8217;im off the face of the earth. I&#8217;m going to kill
him, by grab, the same as I would a rattlesnake; I&#8217;m going
to&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t talk that way!&#8221; broke in Wilhelmina
impatiently, &#8220;it gives people a bad impression. There isn&#8217;t a man in
Blackwater that isn&#8217;t firmly convinced that you&#8217;re nothing but a bag
of hot air. Well, I don&#8217;t care&#8211;that&#8217;s just what they
said!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahhr!&#8221; scoffed Wunpost, &#8220;them Blackwater stiffs.
They&#8217;re jealous, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but don&#8217;t talk that way,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;It turns
folks against you. Even Father and Mother have noticed it. You&#8217;re always
telling of the big things you&#8217;re going to do&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t I <i>do</i>&#8217;em?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;What did I ever say I&#8217;d do that I didn&#8217;t make good, in the
end? Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m going to get this bad
<i>hombre</i>&#8211;this feller that&#8217;s following me through the hills?
Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. If I don&#8217;t bring you his
hair inside of a month&#8211;you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_189'></a>189</span> can have my mine and everything. But I&#8217;m
going to <i>git</i> him, see? I&#8217;m going to toll him across the Valley,
where he&#8217;ll have to come out into the open, and when I ketch him I&#8217;m
going to scalp him. He&#8217;s nothing but a low-down, murdering assassin that
old Eells or somebody has hired&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>please</i>!&#8221; she protested and his eyes opened big before
they closed down in a sudden scowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; he said and packed and rode off in
silence.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WAR EAGLE</span></h2>

<p>Since a bullet from nowhere had shot him through the leg, Wunpost had learned
a new fear of the hills. Before, they had been his stamping-ground, the
&#8220;high places&#8221; he was so boastful of; but now they became imbued with
a malign personality, all the more fearful because it was unknown. With
painstaking care he had checked up on Pisen-face Lynch, to determine if it was
he who had ambushed him; but Lynch had established a perfect alibi&#8211;in
fact, it was almost too good. He had been right in Blackwater during all the
trouble, although now he was out in the hills; and an Indian whom Wunpost had
sent on a scout reported that the Shoshones had no knowledge of the shooting.
They, too, had become aware of the strange presence in the hills, though none of
them had really seen it, and their women were afraid to go out after the
piñon-nuts for fear of being caught and stolen.</p>

<p>The prowler was no renegade Shoshone, for his kinsmen would know about him,
and yet Wunpost had a feeling it was an Indian. And he had another
hunch&#8211;that the Indian was employed by Eels and Pisen-face Lynch. For,
despite Wilhelmina&#8217;s statement, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_191'></a>191</span>there was one man in Blackwater who did not consider
him a bag of hot air. Judson Eells took him seriously, so seriously, in fact,
that he was spending thousands of dollars on detectives; and Wunpost knew for a
certainty that there was a party in the hills, waiting and watching to trail him
to his mine. His departure from Los Angeles had been promptly reported, and
Lynch and several others had left town&#8211;which was yet another reason why
Wunpost quit the hills and went north over the Death Valley Trail.</p>

<p>Life had suddenly become a serious affair to the man who had discovered the
Willie Meena, and as he neared that mine he veered off to the right and took the
high ground to Wild Rose. Yet he could not but observe that the mine was looking
dead, and rumor had it that the paystreak had failed. The low-grade was still
there and Eells was still working it; but out on the desert and sixty miles from
the railroad it could hardly be expected to pay. No, Judson Eells was desperate,
for he saw his treasure slipping as the Wunpost had slipped away before; it was
slipping through his fingers and he grasped at any straw which might help him to
find the Sockdolager. It was the curse of the Panamints that the veins all
pinched out or ran into hungry ore; and for the second time, when he had
esteemed himself rich, he had found the bottom of the hole. He had built roads
and piped water and set up a mill and settled down to make his pile; and then,
with that strange fatality which seemed to pursue him, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>he had seen his profits fail. The assays
had shown that his pay-ore was limited and that soon the Willie Meena must
close, and now he was taking the last of his surplus and making a desperate
fight for the Sockdolager.</p>

<p>Half the new mine was his, according to law, and since Wunpost had dared him
to do his worst he was taking him at his word. And Wunpost at last was getting
scared, though not exactly of Eells. For, since he alone knew the location of
his mine, and no one could find it if he were dead, it stood to reason that
Eells would never kill him, or give orders to his agents to kill. But what those
agents were doing while they were out in the field, and how far they would
respect his wishes, was something about which Eells knew no more than Wunpost,
if, in fact, he knew as much. For Wunpost had a limp in his good right leg which
partially conveyed the answer, and it was his private opinion that Lynch had
gone bad and was out in the hills to kill him. Hence his avoidance of the peaks,
and even the open trail; and the way he rode into water after dark.</p>

<p>There were Indians at Wild Rose, Shooshon Johnny and his family on their way
to Furnace Creek for the winter; but though they were friendly Wunpost left in
the night and camped far out on the plain. It was the same sandy plain over
which he had fled when he had led Lynch to Poison Spring, and as he went on at
dawn Wunpost felt the first vague misgivings for his part in that unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>affair. It had lost
him a lot of friends and steeled his enemies against him&#8211;Lynch no longer
was working by the day&#8211;and sooner or later it was likely to cost him dear,
for no man can win all the time. Yet he had thrown down the gauntlet, and if he
weakened now and quit his name would be a byword on the desert. And besides he
had made his boast to Wilhelmina that he would come back with his
assailant&#8217;s back hair.</p>

<p>It was a matter of pride with John C. Calhoun that, for all his wild talk, he
never made his brag without trying to live up to his word. He had stated in
public that he was going to break Eells, and he fully intended to do so; and his
promise to get Lynch and Phillip F. Lapham was never out of his mind; but this
assassin, this murderer, who had shot him without cause and then crawled off
through the boulders like a snake&#8211;Wunpost had schemed night and day from
the moment he was hit to bring the sneaking miscreant to book. He had some
steel-traps in his packs which might serve to good purpose if he could once get
the man-hunter on his trail; and he still fondly hoped to lure him over into
Death Valley, where he would have to come out of the hills.</p>

<p>No man could cross that Valley without leaving his tracks, for there were
alkali flats for miles; and when, in turn, Wunpost wished to cover his own
trail, there was always the Devil&#8217;s Playground. There, whenever the wind
blew, the great sandhills were on the move, covering up and at the same time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>laying bare; and
when a sand storm came on he could lose his tracks half an hour after they were
made. It was a big country, and wild, no man lived there for sixty
miles&#8211;they could fight it out, alone.</p>

<p>From Emigrant Spring, where he camped after dark, Wunpost rode out before
dawn and was well clear of the hills before it was light enough to shoot. The
broad bulwark of Tucki Mountain, rising up on his right, might give a last
shelter to his enemy; but now he was in the open with Emigrant Wash straight
ahead and Death Valley lying white beyond. And over beyond that, like a wall of
layer cake, rose the striated buttresses of the Grapevines. Wunpost passed down
over the road up which the Nevada rush had come when he had made his great
strike at Black Point; and as he rollicked along on his fast-walking mule, with
the two pack-animals following behind, something rose up within him to tell him
the world was good and that a lucky star was leading him on.</p>

<p>He was heading across the Valley to the Grapevine Range, and the hateful imp
of evil which had dogged him through the Panamints would have to come down and
leave a trail. And once he found his tracks Wunpost would know who he was
fighting, and he could govern himself accordingly. If it was an Indian, well and
good; if it was Lynch, still well and good; but no man can be brave when he is
fighting in the dark or fleeing from an unseen hand. From their lookouts on the
heights his enemies could see him traveling and trace him with <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>their glasses all day;
but when night fell they would lose him, and then someone would have to descend
and pick up his trail in the sands.</p>

<p>Wunpost camped that evening at Surveyor&#8217;s Well, a trench-hole dug down
into the Sink, and after his mules had eaten their fill of salt-grass he packed
up again and pushed on to the east. From the stinking alkali flat with its
mesquite clumps and sacaton, he passed on up an interminable wash; and at
daylight he was hidden in the depths of a black canyon which ended abruptly
behind him. There was no way to reach him, or even see where he was hid, except
by following up the canyon; and before he went to sleep Wunpost got out his two
bear-traps and planted them hurriedly in the trail. Then, retiring into a cave,
he left Good Luck on guard and slept until late in the day. But nothing stirred
down the trail, his watch-dog was silent&#8211;he was hidden from all the
world.</p>

<p>That evening just at dusk he went back down the trail and set his bear traps
again, but not even a prowling fox came along in the night to spring their cruel
jaws. The canyon was deserted and the water-hole where he drank was unvisited
except by his mules. These he had penned in above him by a fence of brush and
ropes and hobbled them to make doubly sure; but in the morning they were there,
waiting to receive their bait of grain as if Tank Canyon was their customary
home. Another day dragged by and Wunpost began to fidget and to watch the
unscalable peaks, but no Indian&#8217;s head <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_196'></a>196</span>appeared to draw a slug from his rifle and again the
night passed uneventfully. He spent the third day in a fury, pacing up and down
his cave, and at nightfall he packed up and was gone.</p>

<p>Three days was enough to wait on the man who had shot him down from the
heights and, now that he thought of it, he was taking a great deal for granted
when he set his big traps in the trail. In the first place, he was assuming that
the man was still there, after a lapse of six weeks and more; and in the second
place that he was bold enough, or so obsessed by blood-lust, that he would
follow him across Death Valley; whereas as a matter of fact, he knew nothing
whatever about him except that he had shot him in the leg. His aim had been good
but a little too low, which is unusual when shooting down hill, and that might
argue him a white man; but his hiding had been better, and his absolute
patience, and that looked more like an Indian. But whoever he was, it was taking
too much for granted to think that he would walk into a trap. What Wunpost
wanted to know, and what he was about to find out, was whether his tracks had
been followed.</p>

<p>He left Tank Canyon after dark, driving his pack-mules before him to detect
any possible ambush; and in his nest on the front pack Good Luck stood up like a
sentinel, eager to scent out the lurking foe. For the past day and night Good
Luck had been uneasy, snuffing the wind and growling in his throat, but the
actions of his master had been cause enough for that, for he responded to
Wunpost&#8217;s every mood. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_197'></a>197</span>And Wunpost was as jumpy as a cat that has been
chased by a dog, he practised for hours on the draw-and-shoot; and whenever he
dismounted he dragged his rifle with him to make sure he would do it in a pinch.
He was worried but not frightened and when he came free from the canyon he
headed for Surveyor&#8217;s Well.</p>

<p>Someone had been there before him, perhaps even that very night, for water
had been splashed about the hole; but whoever it was, was gone. Wunpost studied
the unshod horse-track, then he began to cut circles in the snow-white alkali
and at last he sat down to await the dawn. There was something eerie about this
pursuit, if pursuit it was, for while the horse had been watered from the bucket
at the well, its rider had not left a track. Not a heel-mark, not a nail-point,
and the last of the water had been dropped craftily on the spot where he had
mounted. That was enough&#8211;Wunpost knew he had met his match. He watered his
mules again, rode west into the mesquite brush and at sun-up he was hid for the
day.</p>

<p>Where three giant mesquite trees, their tops reared high in the air and their
trunks banked up with sand, sprawled together to make a natural barricade,
Wunpost unpacked his mules and tied them there to browse while he climbed to the
top of a mound. The desert was quite bare as far as he could see&#8211;no
horseman came or went, every distant trail was empty, the way to Tank Canyon was
untrod. And yet somewhere there must be a man <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_198'></a>198</span>and a horse&#8211;a very ordinary horse, such as any
man might have, and a man who wiped out his tracks. Wunpost lay there a long
time, sweeping the washes with his glasses, and then a shadow passed over him
and was gone. He jumped and a glossy raven, his head turned to one side, gave
vent to a loud, throaty <i>quawk</i>! His mate followed behind him, her wings
rustling noisily, her beady eye fixed on his camp, and Wunpost looked up and
cursed back at them.</p>

<p>If the ravens on the mountain had made out his hiding-place and come down
from their crags to look, what was to prevent this man who smoothed out his
tracks from detecting his hidden retreat? Wunpost knew the ravens well, for no
man ever crossed Death Valley without hearing the whish of black wings, but he
wondered now if this early morning visit did not presage disaster to come. What
the ravens really sought for he knew all too well, for he had seen their knotted
tracks by dead forms; yet somehow their passage conjured up thoughts in his
brain which had never disturbed him before. They were birds of death, rapacious
and evil-bringing, and they had cast their boding shadows upon him.</p>

<p>The dank coolness of the morning gave place to ardent midday before he crept
down and gave up his watch, but as he crouched beneath the trees another shadow
passed over him and cast a slow circle through the brush. It was a pair of black
eagles, come down from the Panamints to throw a fateful <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>circle above <i>him</i>, and in all his
wanderings it had never happened before that an eagle had circled his camp. A
superstitious chill made Wunpost shudder and draw back, for the Shoshones had
told him that the eagles loved men&#8217;s battles and came from afar to watch.
They had learned in the old days that when one war-party followed another there
would later be feasting and blood; and now, when one man followed another across
the desert, they came down from their high cliffs to look. Wunpost scrambled to
his hillock and watched their effortless flight; and they swung to the north,
where they circled again, not far from the spot where he was hid. Here was an
omen indeed, a sign without fail, for below where they circled his enemy was
hiding&#8211;or slipping up through the brush to shoot.</p>

<p>We can all stand so much of superstitious fear and then the best nerves must
crack&#8211;Wunpost saddled his mules and struck out due south, turning off into
the &#8220;self-rising ground.&#8221; Here in bloated bubbles of salt and
poisonous niter the ground had boiled up and formed a brittle crust, like dough
made of self-rising flour. It was a dangerous place to go, for at uncertain
intervals his mules caved through to their hocks, but Wunpost did not stop till
he had crossed to the other side and put ten miles of salt-flats behind him. He
was haunted by a fear of something he could not name, of a presence which
pursued him like a devil; but as he stopped and looked back the hot curses
rushed to his lips and he headed boldly for the mouth of Tank Canyon.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A LOCK OF HAIR</span></h2>

<p>It is no disgrace to flee the unknown, for Nature has made that an instinct;
but the will to overcome conquers even this last of fears and steels a
man&#8217;s nerves to face anything. The heroes of antiquity set their lances
against dragons and creatures that belched forth flame and smoke&#8211;brave
Perseus slew the Gorgon, and Jason the brass-hooved bulls, and St. George and
many another slew his &#8220;worm.&#8221; But the dragons are all dead or driven
to the depths of the sea, whence they rise up to chill men&#8217;s blood; and
those who conquer now fight only their memory, passed down in our fear of the
unknown. And Perseus and Jason had gods and sorceresses to protect them, but
Wunpost turned back alone.</p>

<p>He entered Tank Canyon just as the sun sank in the west; and there at its
entrance he found horse-tracks, showing dimly among the rocks. His enemy had
been there, a day or two before, but he too had feared the unknown. He had gazed
into that narrow passageway and turned away, to wait at Surveyor&#8217;s Well
for his coming. And Wunpost had come, but the eagles had saved him to give
battle once more on his own ground. Tank Canyon was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>his stronghold, inaccessible from
behind, cut off from the sides by high walls; and the evil one who pursued him
must now brave its dark depths or play an Indian game and wait.</p>

<p>Wunpost threw off his packs and left his mules to fret while he ran back to
plant the huge traps. They were not the largest size that would break a
man&#8217;s leg, but yet large enough to hold their victim firm against all the
force he could exert. Their jaws spread a good foot and two powerful springs
lurked beneath to give them a jump; and once the blow was struck nothing could
pry those teeth apart but the clamps, which were operated by screws. A man
caught in such a trap would be doomed to certain death if no one came to his aid
and Wunpost&#8217;s lips curled ferociously as he rose up from his knees and
regarded his cunning handiwork. His traps were set not far apart, in the two
holes he had dug before, and covered with the greatest care; but one was in the
trail, where a man would naturally step, and the other was out in the rocks. A
bush, pulled carelessly down, stuck out from the bank like a fragile but
compelling hand; and Wunpost knew that the prowler would step around it by
instinct, which would throw him into the trap.</p>

<p>The night was black in Tank Canyon and only a pathway of stars showed the
edge of the boxed-in walls; it was black and very silent, for not a mouse was
abroad, and yet Wunpost and his dog could not sleep. A dozen times before
midnight Good Luck leapt up growling and bestrode his master&#8217;s form, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>and at last he rushed out
barking, his voice rising to a yell as he paused and listened through the
silence. Wunpost lay in bed and waited, then rose cautiously up and peered from
the mouth of the cave. A pale moon was shining on the jagged rocks above and
there was a grayness that foretold the dawn, but the bottom of Tank Canyon was
still dark as a pocket and he went back to wait for the day. Good Luck came back
whining, and a growl rumbled in his throat&#8211;then he leapt up again and
Wunpost felt his own hair rise, for a wail had come through the night. He
slapped Good Luck into silence and listened again&#8211;and it came, a wild,
animal-like cry. Yet it was the voice of a man and Wunpost sprang to his feet
all a-tremble to gaze on his catch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; he chuckled and drew on his boots; then
tied up the dog and slipped out into the night.</p>

<p>The dawn had come when he rose up from behind a boulder and strained his eyes
in the uncertain light, and where the trap had been there was now a rocking form
which let out hoarse grunts of pain. It rose up suddenly and as the head came in
view Wunpost saw that his pursuer was an Indian. His hair was long and cut off
straight above the shoulders in the old-time Indian silhouette; but this buck
was no Shoshone, for they have given up the breech-clout and he wore a cloth
about his hips.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;lo!&#8221; he hailed and Wunpost ducked back for he did not trust
his guest. He was the man, beyond a doubt, who had shot him from the ridge; and
such <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>a man would
shoot again. So he dropped down and lay silent, listening to the rattle of the
huge chain and the vicious clash of the trap, and the Indian burst out
scolding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whassa mala!&#8221; he gritted, &#8220;my foot get caught in trap. You
come fixum&#8211;fixum quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wunpost rose up slowly and peered out through a crack and he caught the gleam
of a gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You throw away that gun!&#8221; he returned from behind the boulder
and at last he heard it clatter among the rocks. &#8220;Now your pistol!&#8221;
he ordered, but the Indian burst out angrily in his guttural native tongue. What
he said could only be guessed from his scolding tone of voice; but after a
sullen pause he dropped back into English, this time complaining and insolently
defiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shut up!&#8221; commanded Wunpost suddenly rising above his rock
and covering the Indian with his gun, &#8220;and throw away that pistol or
I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian reared up and faced him, then reached inside his waistband and
threw a wicked gun into the dirt. He was grinding his teeth with pain, like a
gopher in a trap, and his brows were drawn down in a fierce scowl; but Wunpost
only laughed as he advanced upon him slowly, his gun held ready to shoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like it, eh?&#8221; he taunted, &#8220;well, I
didn&#8217;t like <i>this</i> when you up and shot me through the leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slapped his leg and the Indian seemed to understand&#8211;or perhaps he
misunderstood; his hand <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span>leapt like a flash to a butcher knife in his
moccasin-leg and Wunpost jumped as it went past his ribs. Then a silence fell,
in which the fate of a human life hung on the remnant of what some people call
pity, and Wunpost&#8217;s trigger-finger relaxed. But it was not pity, it was
just an age-old feeling against shooting a man in a trap. Or perhaps it was
pride and the white man&#8217;s instinct not to foul his clean hands with
butcher&#8217;s blood. Wunpost wanted to kill him but he stepped back instead
and looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rattlesnake-eyed dastard!&#8221; he hissed between his teeth and
the Indian began to beg. Wunpost listened to him coldly, his eyes bulging with
rage, and then he backed off and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who you working for?&#8221; he asked and as the Indian turned glum he
rolled a cigarette and waited. The jaws of the steel-trap had caught him by the
heel, stabbing their teeth through into the flesh, and in spite of his stoicism
the Indian rocked back and forth and his little eyes glinted with the agony. Yet
he would not talk and Wunpost went off and left him, after gathering up his guns
and the knife. There was something about that butcher-knife and the way it was
flung which roused all the evil in Wunpost&#8217;s heart and he meditated darkly
whether to let the Indian go or give him his just deserts. But first he intended
to wring a confession from him, and he left him to rattle his chain.</p>

<p>Wunpost cooked a hasty breakfast and fed and saddled his mules and then, as
the Indian began <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>to
shout for help, he walked down and glanced at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let me go!&#8221; ordered the Indian, drawing himself up
arrogantly and shaking the coarse hair from his eyes, and Wunpost laughed
disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;and what you doing over here?
I know them buckskin <i>tewas</i>&#8211;you&#8217;re an Apache!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sí</i>&#8211;Apache!&#8221; agreed the Indian. &#8220;I come over
here&#8211;hunt sheep. What for you settum trap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Settum trap&#8211;ketch you,&#8221; answered Wunpost succinctly.
&#8220;You bad Injun&#8211;maybeso I kill you. Who hired you to come over here
and kill me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the sullen silence, the stubborn turn of the head, the suffering
compression of the lips; and Wunpost went back to his camp. The Indian was an
Apache, he had known it from the start by his <i>tewas</i> and the cut of his
hair; for no Indian in California wears high-topped buckskin moccasins with a
little canoe-prow on the toe. That was a mountain-Apache device, that little
disc of rawhide, to protect the wearer&#8217;s toes from rocks and cactus, and
someone had imported this buck. Of course, it was Lynch but it was different to
make him <i>say</i> so&#8211;but Wunpost knew how an Apache would go about it.
He would light a little fire under his fellow-man and see if that wouldn&#8217;t
help. However there are ways which answer just as well, and Wunpost packed and
mounted and rode down past the trap. Or at least he tried to, but his mules were
so frightened that it took all his strength to haze them <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> past. As for Good Luck, he flew at the
Indian in a fury of barking and was nearly struck dead by a rock. The Apache was
fighting mad, until Wunpost came back and tamed him; and then Wunpost spoke
straight out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you!&#8221; he said, &#8220;you savvy coyote? You want him come
eat you up? Well, <i>talk</i> then, you dastard; or I&#8217;ll go off and leave
you. Come through now&#8211;who brought you over here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Apache looked up at him from under his banged hair and his evil eyes
roved fearfully about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big fat man,&#8221; he lied and Wunpost smiled grimly&#8211;he would
tell this later to Eells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; he said and shook his head warningly at which the Indian
seemed to meditate his plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big tall man,&#8221; he amended and Wunpost nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What name you callum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Callum Lynchie,&#8221; admitted the Apache with a sickly grin,
&#8220;she come San Carlos&#8211;busca scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>busca</i> scout, eh?&#8221; repeated Wunpost. &#8220;What for
wantum scout? Plenty Shooshonnie scout, over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah! Shooshonnie no good!&#8221; spat the Apache contemptuously.
&#8220;Me <i>scout</i>&#8211;me work for Government! Injun scout&#8211;you
savvy? Follow tracks for soldier. Me Manuel Apache&#8211;big chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, big chief!&#8221; scoffed Wunpost, &#8220;but you ain&#8217;t no
scout, Manuel, or you wouldn&#8217;t be caught here in this trap. Now listen,
Mr. Injun&#8211;you want to go home? You want to go see your squaw? Well, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>s&#8217;pose I let you loose,
what you think you&#8217;re going to do&#8211;follow me up and shoot me for
Lynch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No shootum for Lynchie!&#8221; denied the Apache vigorously.
&#8220;Lynchie&#8211;she say, <i>busca</i> mine! <i>Busca</i> gol&#8217; mine,
savvy&#8211;but &#8217;nother man she say, you ketchum plenty money&#8211;in
pants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-ho!&#8221; exclaimed Wunpost as the idea suddenly dawned on him and
once more he experienced a twinge of regret. This time it was for the occasion
when he had shown scornful Blackwater that seven thousand dollars in bills. And
he had with him now&#8211;in his pants, as the Indian said&#8211;no less than
thirty thousand dollars in one roll. And all because he had lost his faith in
banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shoot me&#8211;get money?&#8221; he inquired, slapping his leg;
and Manuel Apache grinned guiltily. He was caught now, and ashamed, but not of
attempting murder&#8211;he was ashamed of having been caught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trap hurt!&#8221; he complained, drawing up his wrinkled face and
rattling his chain impatiently, and Wunpost nodded gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll turn you loose. A man
that will flash his roll like I did in Blackwater&#8211;he <i>deserves</i> to get
shot in the leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his rope from the saddle and noosed the Indian about both arms, after
which he stretched him out as he would a fighting wildcat and loosened the
springs with his clamps.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you do?&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;if I let you go?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>&#8220;Go
home!&#8221; snarled Manuel, &#8220;Lynchie no good&#8211;me no likum. Me your
friend&#8211;no shootum&#8211;go home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better,&#8221; warned Wunpost, &#8220;because next
time I&#8217;ll kill you. Oh, by grab, I nearly forgot!&#8221;</p>

<p>He whipped out the butcher-knife which the Apache had flung at him and
cropped off a lock of his hair. It was something he had promised Wilhelmina.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FEAR OF THE HILLS</span></h2>

<p>Wunpost romped off down the canyon, holding the hair up like a
scalp-lock&#8211;which it was, except for the scalp. Manuel Apache, with the
pride of his kind, had knotted it up in a purple silk handkerchief; and he had
yelled louder when he found it was gone than he had when he was caught in the
trap. He had, in fact, acted extremely unreasonable, considering all that had
been done for him; and Wunpost had been obliged to throw down on him with his
six-shooter and order him off up the canyon. It was taking a big chance to allow
him to live at all and, not to tempt him too far along the lines of reprisal,
Wunpost left the Apache afoot. His gaunted pony was feeding hobbled, down the
canyon, and Wunpost took off the rawhide thongs and hung them about his neck,
after which he drove him on with his mules. But even at that he was taking a
chance, or so at least it seemed, for the look in the Apache&#8217;s eye as he
had limped off up the gulch reminded Wunpost of a broken-backed rattlesnake.</p>

<p>He was a bad Indian and a bad actor&#8211;one of these men that throw
butcher-knives&#8211;and yet Wunpost <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_210'></a>210</span>had tamed him and set him afoot and come off with
his back-hair, as promised. He was a Government scout, the pick of the Apaches,
and he had matched his desert craft against Wunpost&#8217;s; but that craft,
while it was good, was not good enough, and he had walked right into a
bear-trap. Not the trap in the trail&#8211;he had gone around that&#8211;but the
one in the rocks, with the step-diverting bush pulled down. Wunpost had gauged
it to a nicety and this big chief of the Apaches had lost out in the duel of
wits. He had lost his horse and he had lost his hair; and that pain in his heel
would be a warning for some time not to follow after Wunpost, the
desert-man.</p>

<p>There were others, of course, who claimed to be desert-men and to know Death
Valley like a book; but it was self-evident to Wunpost as he rode back with his
trophies that he was the king of them all. He had taken on Lynch and his
desert-bred Shoshone and led them the devil&#8217;s own chase; and now he had
taken on Manuel, the big chief of the Apaches, and left him afoot in the rocks.
But one thing he had learned from this snakey-eyed man-killer&#8211;he would
better get rid of his money. For there were others still in the hills who might
pot him for it any time&#8211;and besides, it was a useless risk. He was taking
chances enough without making it an object for every miscreant in the country to
shoot him.</p>

<p>He camped that noon at Surveyor&#8217;s Well, to give his mules a good feed
of grass, and as he sat out in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span>the open the two ravens came by, but now he laughed
at their croaks. Even if the eagles came by he would not lose his nerve again,
for he was fighting against men that he knew. Pisen-face Lynch and his gang were
no better than he was&#8211;they left a track and followed the trails&#8211;and
after he had announced that his money was all banked they would have no
inducement to kill him. The inducements, in fact, would be all the other way;
because the man that killed him would be fully as foolish as the one that killed
the goose for her egg. He alone was the repository of that great and golden
secret, the whereabouts of the Sockdolager Mine; and if they killed him out of
spite neither Eells nor any of his man-hunters would ever see the color of its
ore.</p>

<p>Wunpost stretched his arms and laughed, but as he was saddling up his mules
he saw a smoke, rising up from the mouth of Tank Canyon. It was not in the
Canyon but high up on a point and he knew it was Manuel Apache. He was signaling
across the Valley to his boss in the Panamints that he was in distress and
needed help, but no answering smoke rose up from Tucki Mountain to show where
Wunpost&#8217;s enemies lay hid. The Panamints stood out clean in the brilliant
November light and each purple canyon seemed to invite him to its shelter, so
sweetly did they lie in the sun. And yet, as that thin smoke bellied up and was
smothered back again in the smoke-talk that the Apaches know so well, Wunpost
wondered if its message was only a call for help&#8211;it might be a warning to
Lynch. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>Or it might
be a signal to still other Apaches who were watching his coming from the
heights, and as Wunpost looked again his hand sought out the Indian&#8217;s
scalp-lock and he regarded it almost regretfully.</p>

<p>Why had he envenomed that ruthless savage by lifting his scalp-lock, the
token of his warrior&#8217;s pride; when by treating him generously he might
have won his good will and thus have one less enemy in the hills? Perhaps
Wilhelmina had been right&#8211;it was to make good on a boast which might much
better have never been uttered. He had bet her his mine and everything he had, a
thing quite unnecessary to do; and then to make good he had deprived this Indian
of his hair, which alone might put him back on his trail. He might get another
horse and take up once more that relentless and murderous pursuit; and this
time, like Lynch, he would be out for blood and not for the money there was in
it.</p>

<p>Wunpost sighed and cinched his packs and hit out across the flats for the
mouth of Emigrant Wash. But the thought that other Apaches might be in
Lynch&#8217;s employ quite poisoned Wunpost&#8217;s flowing cup of happiness,
and as he drew near the gap which led off to Emigrant Springs he stopped and
looked up at the mountains. They were high, he knew, and his mules were tired,
but something told him not to go through that gap. It was a narrow passageway
through the hills, not forty feet wide, and all along its sides there were caves
in the cliffs where a hundred men could hide. And why should <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>Manuel Apache be making
fancy smoke-talks if no one but white men were there? Why not make a straight
smoke, the way a white man would, and let it go at that? Wunpost shook his head
sagely and turned away from the gap&#8211;he had had enough excitement for that
trip.</p>

<p>Bone Canyon, for which he headed, was still far away and the sun was getting
low; but Wunpost knew, even if others did not, that there was a water-hole well
up towards the summit. A cloudburst had sluiced the canyon from top to bottom
and spread out a great fan of dirt; but in the earlier days an Indian trail had
wound up it, passing by the hidden spring. And if he could water his mules there
he could rim out up above and camp on a broad, level flat. Wunpost jogged along
fast, for he had left the pony at Surveyor&#8217;s Well, and as he rode towards
the canyon-mouth he kept his eyes on the ridges to guard against a possible
surprise. For if Lynch and his Indians were watching from the gap they would
notice his turning off to the left, and in that case a good runner might cut
across to Bone Canyon before he could get through the pass. But the mountain
side was empty and as the dusk was gathering he passed through the portals of
Bone Canyon.</p>

<p>Like all desert canyons it boxed in at its mouth, opening out later in a
broad valley behind; his road was the sand-wash, the path of the last
cloudburst, now packed hard and set like stone. In the middle of the sand-wash a
little channel had been dug by <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_214'></a>214</span>the last of the sluicing water; above the wash there
rose another cut-bank where the cloudburst before it had taken out an even
greater slice; and then on both sides there rose high bluffs of conglomerate
which some father of all the cloudbursts had formed. Wunpost was riding in the
lead now on his fast-walking mule, the two pack-animals following wearily along
behind; in his nest on the front pack Good Luck was more than half sleeping,
Wunpost himself was tempted to nod&#8211;and then, from the west bluff, there
was a spit of fire and Wunpost found himself on the ground.</p>

<p>Across his breast and under his arm there was a streak that burned like fire,
his mules were milling and bashing their packs; and as they turned both ways and
ran he rolled over into the channel, with his rifle still clutched in one hand.
Those days of steady practise had not been in vain, for as he went off his mule
he had snatched at his saddle-gun and dragged it from its scabbard. And now he
lay and waited, listening to the running of his mules and the frenzied barking
of his dog; and it came to him vaguely that several shots had been fired, and
some from the east bank of the wash. But the man who had hit him had fired from
the west and Wunpost crept down the wash and looked up.</p>

<p>A trickle of blood was running down his left arm from the bullet wound which
had just missed his heart, but his whole body was tingling with a strength which
could move mountains and he was consumed with a passion for revenge. For the
second <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>time he had
been ambushed and shot by this gang of cold-blooded murderers, and he had no
doubt that their motive was the same as that to which the Indian had confessed.
They had dogged his steps to kill him for his money&#8211;Pisen-face Lynch, or
whoever it was&#8211;but their shooting was poor and as he rose beside a bush
Wunpost took a chance from the east. The man he was looking for had shot from
the west and he ran his eyes along the bluff.</p>

<p>Nothing stirred for a minute and then a round rock suddenly moved and altered
its shape. He thrust out his rifle and drew down on it carefully, but the dusk
put a blur on his sights. His foresight was beginning to loom, his hindsight was
not clean, and he knew that would make him shoot high. He waited, all a-tremble,
the sweat running off his face and mingling with the blood from his arm; and
then the man rose up, head and shoulders against the sky, and he knew his
would-be murderer was Lynch. Wunpost held his gun against the light until the
sights were lined up fine, then swung back for a snap-shot at Lynch; and as the
rifle belched and kicked he caught a flash of a tumbling form and clutching
hands thrown up wildly against the sky. Then he stooped down and ran,
helter-skelter down the wash, regardless of what might be in his way; and as he
plunged around a curve he stampeded a pack-mule which had run that far and
stopped.</p>

<p>It was the smallest of his mules, and the wildest as well, Old Walker and his
mate having gone off up <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_216'></a>216</span>the canyon in a panic which would take them to the
ranch; but it was a mule and, being packed, it could not run far down hill so
Wunpost walked up on it and caught it. Far out in the open, where no enemy could
slip up on him, he halted and made a saddle of the pack, and as he mounted to go
he turned to Tucki Mountain and called down a curse on Lynch. Then he rode back
down the trail that led to Death Valley, for the fear of the hills had come
back.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RETURN OF THE BLOW-HARD</span></h2>

<p>Nothing was seen of John C. Calhoun for nearly a week and then, late one
evening, he stepped in on Judson Eells in his office at the Blackwater Bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, Mr. Calhoun!&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;we&#8211;we all
thought you were dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Calhoun, whose arm was in a sling, &#8220;I
thought so myself for a while. What&#8217;s the good word from Mr.
Lynch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eells dropped back in his chair and stared at him fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;we haven&#8217;t been able to locate him. But you, Mr.
Calhoun&#8211;we&#8217;ve been looking for you everywhere. Your riding mule came
back with his saddle all bloody and a bullet wound across his hip and the
Campbells were terribly distressed. We&#8217;ve had search-parties out
everywhere but no one could find you and at last you were given up for
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw some of those search-parties,&#8221; answered Wunpost
grimly, &#8220;but I noticed that they all packed Winchesters. What&#8217;s the
idee in trying to kill me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we aren&#8217;t trying to kill you!&#8221; burst out <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>Judson Eells vehemently.
&#8220;Quite the contrary, we&#8217;ve been trying to find you. But perhaps you
can tell us about poor Mr. Lynch&#8211;he has disappeared completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about them Apaches?&#8221; inquired Wunpost pointedly, and Judson
Eells went white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;what Apaches?&#8221; he faltered at last and Wunpost
regarded him sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know nothing if you
don&#8217;t. But I reckon they turned the trick. That Manuel Apache was a bad
one.&#8221; He reached back into his hip-pocket and drew out a coiled-up
scalp-lock. &#8220;There&#8217;s his hair,&#8221; he stated, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Did you kill him?&#8221; cried Eells, starting up from his
chair, but Wunpost only shrugged enigmatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t talking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Done too much of that
already. What I&#8217;ve come to say is that I&#8217;ve buried all my money and
I&#8217;m not going back to that mine. So you can call off your bad-men and your
murdering Apache Indians, because there&#8217;s no use following me now.
Thinking about taking a little trip for my health.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused expectantly but Judson Eells was too shocked to make any proper
response. His world was tumbling about him, all his plans had come to
naught&#8211;and Lynch was gone. He longed to question further, to seek out some
clew, but he dared not, for his hands were not clean. He had hired this Apache
whose grisly scalp-lock now lay before him, and the others who had been with
Lynch; and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>if it
ever became known&#x2500;He shuddered and let his lip drop.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is horrible!&#8221; he burst out hoarsely, &#8220;but why should
they kill Lynch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should they kill <i>me</i>?&#8221; added Wunpost.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a nerve,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;bringing those devils
into the country&#8211;don&#8217;t you know they&#8217;re as treacherous as a
rattlesnake? No, you&#8217;ve been going too far; and it&#8217;s a question with
me whether I won&#8217;t report the whole business to the sheriff. But
what&#8217;s the use of making trouble? All I want is that contract&#8211;and
this time I reckon I&#8217;ll get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded confidently but Judson Eells&#8217; proud lip went up and instantly
he became the bold financier.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll never get it, Mr
Calhoun&#8211;not until you take me to the Sockdolager Mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; replied Wunpost &#8220;not for you or any other
man. I stay away from that mine, from now on. Why should I give up a
half&#8211;ain&#8217;t I got thirty thousand dollars, hid out up here under a
stone? Live and let live, sez I, and if you&#8217;ll call off your bad-men
I&#8217;ll agree not to talk to the sheriff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can talk all you wish!&#8221; snapped out Eells with rising
courage, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of your threats. And neither am I afraid of
anything you can do to test the validity of that contract. It will hold,
absolutely, in any court in the land; but if you will take me to your mine and
turn it over in good faith, I will agree to cancel the contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You don&#8217;t want nothing!&#8221; hooted Wunpost <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>sarcastically, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do&#8211;I&#8217;ll give you thirty thousand
dollars, cash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;ve told you my terms, and there&#8217;s no use coming back
to me&#8211;it&#8217;s the Sockdolager Mine or nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yourself,&#8221; returned Wunpost, &#8220;but I&#8217;m just
beginning to wonder whether I&#8217;m shooting it out with the right men.
What&#8217;s the use of fighting murderers, and playing tag with Apache Indians,
when the man that sends &#8217;em out is sitting tight? In fact, why don&#8217;t
I come in here and get <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re wrong!&#8221; answered Eells without giving back
an inch, &#8220;you&#8217;re trying to evade the law. And any man that breaks
the law is a coward at heart, because he knows that all society is against
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds good,&#8221; admitted Wunpost, &#8220;and I&#8217;d almost
believe it if <i>you</i> didn&#8217;t show such a nerve But you know and I know
that you break the law every day&#8211;and some time, Mr. Banker, you&#8217;re
going to get caught. No, you can guess again on why I don&#8217;t shoot
you&#8211;I just like to see you wiggle. I just like to see a big fat slob like
you, that&#8217;s got the whole world bluffed, twist around in his seat when a
<i>man</i> comes along and tells him what a dastard he is. And besides, I git a
laugh, every time I come back and you make me think of the Stinging
Lizard&#8211;and the road! But the biggest laugh I get is when you pull this
virtuous stuff, like the widow-robbing old screw you are, and then have the
nerve to tell me to my face that it&#8217;s the Sockdolager Mine or <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span> nothing. Well,
it&#8217;s nothing then, Mr. Penny-pincher; and if I ever get the chance
I&#8217;ll make you squeal like a pig. And don&#8217;t send no more Apaches
after <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose up and slapped the desk, then picked up the scalp-lock and strode
majestically out the door. But Judson Eells was unimpressed, for he had seen
them squirm before. He was a banker, and he knew all the signs. Nor did John C.
Calhoun laugh as he rode off through the night, for his schemes had gone awry
again. Every word that he had said was as true as Gospel and he could sit around
and wait a life-time&#8211;but waiting was not his long suit. In Los Angeles he
seemed to attract all the bar-flies in the city, who swarmed about and bummed
him for the drinks; and no man could stand their company for more than a few
days without getting thoroughly disgusted. And on the desert, every time he went
out into the hills he was lucky to come back with his life. So what was he to
do, while he was waiting around for this banker to find out he was whipped?</p>

<p>For Eells was whipped, he was foiled at every turn; and yet that muley-cow
lip came up as stubbornly as ever and he tried to tell him, Wunpost, he was
wrong. And that because he was wrong and a law-breaker at heart he was therefore
a coward and doomed to lose. It was ludicrous, the way Eells stood up for his
&#8220;rights,&#8221; when everyone knew he was a thief; and yet that
purse-proud intolerance which is the hall-mark of his class made him think <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>he was entirely right. He
even had the nerve to preach little homilies about trying to evade the law. But
that was it, his very self-sufficiency made him immune against anything but a
club. He had got the idea into his George the Third head that the king can do no
wrong&#8211;and he, of course was the king. If Wunpost made a threat, or
concealed the location of a mine, that was wrong, it was against the law; but
Eells himself had hired some assassins who had shot him, Wunpost, twice, and yet
Eells was game to let it go before the sheriff&#8211;he could not believe he was
wrong.</p>

<p>Wunpost cursed that pride of class which makes all capitalists so hard to
head and put the whole matter from his mind. He had hoped to come back with that
contract in his pocket, to show to the doubting Wilhelmina; but she had had
enough of boasting and if he was ever to win her heart he must learn to feign a
virtue which he lacked. That virtue was humility, the attribute of slaves and
those who are not born to rule; but with her it was a virtue second only to that
Scotch honesty which made upright Cole Campbell lean backwards. He was so
straight he was crooked and cheated himself, so honest that he stood in his own
light; and to carry out his principles he doomed his family to Jail Canyon for
the rest of their natural lives. And yet Wilhelmina loved him and was always
telling what he said and bragging of what he had done, when anyone could see
that he was bull-headed as a mule and hadn&#8217;t one chance in ten thousand to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>win. But all the
same they were good folks, you always knew where you would find them, and
Wilhelmina was as pretty as a picture.</p>

<p>No rouge on those cheeks and yet they were as pink as the petals of a
blushing rose, and her lips were as red as Los Angeles cherries and her eyes
were as honest as the day. Nothing fly about her, she had not learned the tricks
that the candy-girls and waitresses knew, and yet she was as wise as many a
grown man and could think circles around him when it came to an argument. She
could see right through his bluffing and put her finger on the spot which
convinced even him that he was wrong, but if he refrained from opposing her she
was as simple as a child and her only desire was to please. She was not
self-seeking, all she wanted was his company and a chance to give expression to
her thoughts; and when he would listen they got on well enough, it was only when
he boasted that she rebelled. For she could not endure his masculine complacency
and his assumption that success made him right, and when he had gone away she
had told him to his face that he was a blow-hard and his money was tainted.</p>

<p>Wunpost mulled this over, too, as he rode on up Jail Canyon and when he
sighted the house he took Manuel Apache&#8217;s scalp-lock and hid it inside his
pack. After risking his life to bring his love this token he thought better of
it and brought only himself. He would come back a friend, one who had seen
trouble as they had but was not boasting of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_224'></a>224</span>what he had done&#8211;and if anyone asked him what
he had done to Lynch he would pass it off with some joke. So he talked too much,
did he? All right, he would show them; he would close his trap and say nothing;
and in a week Wilhelmina would be following him around everywhere, just begging
to know about his arm. But no, he would tell her it was just a sad accident,
which no one regretted more than he did; and rather than seem to boast he would
say in a general way that it would never happen again. And that would be the
truth, because from what Eells had said he was satisfied the Apaches had buried
Lynch.</p>

<p>But how, now, was he to approach this matter of the money which he was
determined to advance for the road? That would call for diplomacy and he would
have to stick around a while before Billy would listen to reason. But once she
was won over the whole family would be converted; for she was the boss, after
all. She wore the overalls at the Jail Canyon Ranch and in spite of her pretty
ways she had a will of her own that would not be denied. And when she saw him
come back, like a man from the dead&#8211;he paused and blinked his eyes. But
what would <i>he</i> say&#8211;would he tell her what had happened? No, there he
was again, right back where he had started from&#8211;the thing for him to do
was to <i>keep still</i>. Say nothing about Lynch and catching Apaches in
bear-traps, just look happy and listen to her talk.</p>

<p>It was morning and the sun had just touched the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>house which hung like driftwood against
the side of the hill. The mud of the cloudburst had turned to hard
pudding-stone, which resounded beneath his mule&#8217;s feet. The orchard was
half buried, the garden in ruins, the corral still smothered with muck; but as
he rode up the new trail a streak of white quit the house and came bounding down
to meet him. It was Wilhelmina, still dressed in women&#8217;s clothes but quite
forgetful of everything but her joy; and when he dismounted she threw both arms
about his neck, and cried when he gave her a kiss.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SOMETHING NEW</span></h2>

<p>There are compensations for everything, even for being given up for dead, and
as he was welcomed back to life by a sweet kiss from Wilhelmina, Wunpost was
actually glad he had been shot. He was glad he was hungry, for now she would
feed him; glad he was wounded, for she would be his nurse; and when Cole
Campbell and his wife took him in and made much of him he lost his last
bitterness against Lynch. In the first place, Lynch was dead, and not up on the
ridge waiting to pot him for what money he had; and in the second place Lynch
had shot right past his heart and yet had barely wounded him at all. But the
sight of that crease across his breast and the punctured hole through his arm
quite disarmed the Campbells and turned their former disapproval to a hovering
admiration and solicitude.</p>

<p>If the hand of Divine Providence had loosed the waterspout down their canyon
to punish him for his overweening pride, perhaps it had now saved him and turned
the bullet aside to make him meet for repentance. It was something like that
which lay in their minds as they installed him in their best <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>front room, and when they
found that his hardships had left him chastened and silent they even consented
to accept payment for his horse-feed. If they did not, he declared, he would
pack up forthwith and take his whole outfit to Blackwater; and the fact was the
Campbells were so reduced by their misfortunes that they had run up a big bill
at the store. Only occasional contributions from their miner sons in Nevada kept
them from facing actual want, and Campbell was engaged in packing down his
picked ore in order to make a small shipment. But if he figured his own time in
he was not making day&#8217;s wages and the future held out no hope.</p>

<p>Without a road the Homestake Mine was worthless, for it could never be
profitably worked; but Cole Campbell was like Eells in one respect at least, and
that was he never knew when he was whipped. A guarded suggestion had come from
Judson Eells that he might still be persuaded to buy his mine, but Campbell
would not even name a price; and now the store-keeper had sent him notice that
he had discounted his bill at the bank. That was a polite way of saying that
Eells had bought in the account, which constituted a lien against the mine; and
the Campbells were vaguely worried lest Eells should try his well-known tactics
and suddenly deprive them of their treasure. For the Homestake Mine, in Cole
Campbell&#8217;s eyes, was the greatest silver property in the West; and yet
even in this emergency, which threatened daily to become desperate, he refused
resolutely to accept tainted money. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_228'></a>228</span>For not only was Wunpost&#8217;s money placed under
the ban, but so much had been said of Judson Eells and his sharp practises that
his money was also barred.</p>

<p>This much Wunpost gathered on the first day of his home-coming, when, still
dazed by his welcome, he yet had the sense to look happy and say almost nothing.
He sat back in an easy chair with Wilhelmina at his side and the Campbells
hovering benevolently in the distance, and to all attempts to draw him out he
responded with a cryptic smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we were so worried!&#8221; exclaimed Wilhelmina, looking up at him
anxiously, &#8220;because there was blood all over the saddle; and when the
trailers got to Wild Rose they found your pack-mule, and Good Luck with the rope
still fast about his neck. But they just couldn&#8217;t find you anywhere, and
the tracks all disappeared; and when it became known that Mr. Lynch was
missing&#8211;oh, <i>do</i> you think they killed him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search me,&#8221; shrugged Wunpost. &#8220;I was too busy getting out
of there to do any worrying about Lynch. But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing,
about those tracks disappearing&#8211;them Apaches must have smoothed &#8217;em
out, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but why should they kill <i>him</i>? Weren&#8217;t they supposed
to be working for him? That&#8217;s what Mr. Eells gave us to understand. But
wasn&#8217;t it kind of him, when he heard you were missing, to send all those
search-parties out? It must have cost him several hundred dollars. And it shows
that even <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>the men
we like the least are capable of generous impulses. He told Father he
wouldn&#8217;t have it happen for anything&#8211;I mean, for you to come to any
harm. All he wanted, he said, was the mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Wunpost, and she ran on unheeding as he drew down
the corners of his mouth. But he could agree to that quite readily, for he knew
from his own experience that all Eells wanted was the mine. It was only a
question now of what move he would make next to bring about the consummation of
that wish. For it was Eells&#8217; next move, since, according to
Wunpost&#8217;s reasoning, the magnate was already whipped. His plans for
tracing Wunpost to the source of his wealth had ended in absolute disaster and
the only other move he could possibly make would be along the line of
compromise. Wunpost had told him flat that he would not go near his mine, no one
else knew even its probable location; and yet, when he had gone to him and
suggested some compromise, Eells had refused even to consider it. Therefore he
must have other plans in view.</p>

<p>But all this was far away and almost academic to the lovelorn John C.
Calhoun, and if Eells never approached him on the matter of the Sockdolager it
would be soon enough for him. What he wanted was the privilege of helping Billy
feed the chickens and throw down hay to his mules, and then to wander off up the
trail to the tunnel that opened out on the sordid world below. There the
restless money-grabbers were rushing to and fro in their fight for <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>what treasures they knew,
but one kiss from Wilhelmina meant more to him now than all the gold in the
world. But her kisses, like gold, came when least expected and were denied when
he had hoped for them most; and the spell he held over her seemed once more near
to breaking, for on the third day he forgot himself and talked. No, it was not
just talk&#8211;he boasted of his mine, and there for the first time they
jarred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; declared Wilhelmina, &#8220;if you
have got a rich mine! That&#8217;s no reason for saying that Father&#8217;s is
no good; because it is, if it only had a road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now here, if ever, was the golden opportunity for remaining silent and
looking intelligent; but Wunpost forgot his early resolve and gave way to an
ill-timed jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s like the gag the Texas
land-boomer pulled off when he woke up and found himself in hell. &#8216;If it only
had a little more rain and good society&#x2500;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you hush up!&#8221; she cried, her lips beginning to tremble.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve got enough trouble, without your making fun of
it&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m not making fun of you!&#8221; protested Wunpost stoutly.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I offered to build you a road? Well, what&#8217;s the use
of fiddling around, packing silver ore down on burros, when you know from the
start it won&#8217;t pay? First thing you folks know Judson Eells will come down
on you and grab the whole mine for nothing. Why not take some of my money <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>that I&#8217;ve buried
under a rock and put in that aerial tramway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we don&#8217;t want to!&#8221; answered Wilhelmina tearfully;
&#8220;my father wants a <i>road</i>. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s very
kind of you, after all we have suffered, to speak as if we were <i>fools</i>. If
it wasn&#8217;t for that waterspout that washed away our road we&#8217;d be
richer than you are, today!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; drawled Wunpost; &#8220;you don&#8217;t
know how rich I am. I can take my mules and be back here in three days with ten
thousand dollars worth of ore!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot!&#8221; she contradicted, and Wunpost&#8217;s eyes began to
bulge&#8211;he was not used to lovely woman and her ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just bet you I can,&#8221; he responded deliberately.
&#8220;What&#8217;ll you bet that I can&#8217;t turn the trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got anything to bet,&#8221; retorted Wilhelmina
angrily, &#8220;but if I did have, and it was right, I&#8217;d bet every cent I
had&#8211;you&#8217;re always making big brags!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so you say,&#8221; replied Wunpost evenly, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll
tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll put up a mule-load of ore against
another sweet kiss&#8211;like you give me when I first came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilhelmina bowed her head and blushed painfully beneath her curls and then
she turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t sell kisses,&#8221; she said, and when he saw she was
offended he put aside his arrogant ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know, kid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you were just glad <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>to see me&#8211;but why
can&#8217;t you be glad all the time? Ain&#8217;t I the same man? Well, you
ought to be glad then, if you see me coming back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But somebody might kill you!&#8221; she answered quickly, &#8220;and
then I&#8217;d be to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re scared to try it!&#8221; he boasted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got &#8217;em bluffed out. They ain&#8217;t a man left in the hills. And
besides, I told Eells I wouldn&#8217;t go near the mine until he came through
and sold me that contract. They&#8217;s nobody watching me now. And you can take
the ore, if you should happen to win, and build your father a road.&#8221;</p>

<p>She straightened up and gazed at him with her honest brown eyes, and at last
the look in them changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she burst out recklessly,
&#8220;and besides, you&#8217;re not going to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I want that kiss, too. Here,
pup!&#8221; and he whistled to his dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t take Good Luck!&#8221; she objected quickly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s my dog now, and I want him!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pouted and tossed her pretty head to one side, and Wunpost smiled at her
tyranny. It was something new in their relations with each other and it struck
him as quite piquant and charming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right,&#8221; he assented, and Billy hid her face; because
treachery was new to her too.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CHALLENGE</span></h2>

<p>If love begets love and deceit begets deceit, then Wunpost was repaid
according to his merits when Wilhelmina laid claim to his dog. She did it in a
way that was almost coquettish, for coquetry is a form of deceit; but in the
morning, when he was gone, she put his dog on his trail and followed along
behind on her mule. And this, of course, was rank treachery no less, for her
purpose was to discover his mine. If she found it, she had decided in the small
hours of the night, she would locate it and claim it all; and that would teach
him not to make fun of honest poverty or to try to buy kisses with gold. Because
kisses, as she knew, could never be true unless they were given for love; and
love itself calls for respect, first of all&#8211;and who can respect a
boaster?</p>

<p>She reasoned in circles, as the best of us will when trying to justify
doubtful acts; but she traveled in a straight line when she picked up
Wunpost&#8217;s trail and followed him over the rocks. He had ridden out in the
night, turning straight up the ridge where the mountain-sheep trail came down;
and Good Luck bounded ahead of her, his nose to the ground, his <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>bobbed tail working like
mad. There was a dew on the ground, for the nights had turned cold and, though
he was no hound, Good Luck could follow the scent, which was only a few hours
old. Wunpost had slept till after midnight and then silently departed, taking
only Old Walker and his mate; and the trail of their sharp-shod shoes was easily
discernible except where they went over smooth rocks. It was here that Wunpost
circled, to throw off possible pursuit; but busy little Good Luck was frantic to
come up to him, and he smelled out the tracks and led on.</p>

<p>Wunpost had traveled in the night, and, after circling a few times, his trail
straightened out and fell into a dim path which had been traversed by mules once
before. Up and up it led, until Tellurium was exhausted and Wilhelmina had to
get off and walk; and at last, when it was almost at the summit of the range, it
entered a great stone patch and was lost. But the stone-patch was not limitless,
and Wilhelmina was determined&#8211;she rode out around it, and soon Good Luck
dropped his nose and set out straight to the south. To the south! That would
take him into the canyon above Blackwater, where the pocket-miners had their
claims; but surely the great Sockdolager was not over there, for the district
had been worked for years.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina&#8217;s heart stopped as she looked out the country from the high
ridge beyond the stone-patch&#8211;could it be that his mine was close? Was it
possible <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>that his
great strike was right there at their door while they had been searching for it
clear across Death Valley? It was like the crafty Wunpost always to head north
when his mine was hidden safely to the south; and yet how had it escaped the
eyes of the prospectors who had been combing the hills for months? Where was it
possible for a mine to be hid in all that expanse of peaks? She sat down on the
summit and considered.</p>

<p>Happy Canyon lay below her, leading off to the west towards Blackwater and
the Sink, and beyond and to the south there was a jumble of sharp-peaked hills
painted with stripes of red and yellow and white. It was a rough country, and
bone dry; perhaps the prospectors had avoided it and so failed to find his lost
mine. Or perhaps he was throwing a circle out through this broken ground to come
back by Hungry Bill&#8217;s ranch. Wilhelmina sat and meditated, searching the
country with the very glasses which Wunpost himself had given her; and Good Luck
came back and whined. He had found his master&#8217;s trail, it led on to the
south, and now Wilhelmina would not come. She did not even take notice of him,
and after watching her face Good Luck turned and ran resolutely on. He knew
whose dog he was, even if she did not; and after calling to him perfunctorily
Wilhelmina let him go, for even this defection might be used.</p>

<p>Wunpost was so puffed up with pride over the devotion of his dog that he
would be pleased beyond <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_236'></a>236</span>measure to have him follow, and from her lookout on
the ridge she could watch where Good Luck went and spy out the trail for miles.
It was time to turn back if she was to reach home by dark, but that white,
scurrying form was too good a marker and she followed him through her glasses
for an hour. He would go bounding up some ridge and plunge down into the next
canyon; and then, still running, he would top another summit until at last he
was lost in a black canyon. It was different from the rest, its huge flank
veiled in shadow until it was black as the entrance to a cavern; and the piebald
point that crowned its southern rim was touched with a broad splash of white.
Wilhelmina marked it well and then she turned back with crazy schemes still
chasing through her brain.</p>

<p>Time and again Wunpost had boasted that his mine was not staked, and that it
lay there a prize for the first man who found it or trailed him to his mine.
Well, she, Wilhelmina, had trailed him part way; and after he was gone she would
ride to that black canyon and look for big chunks of gold. And if she ever found
his mine she would locate it for herself, and have her claim recorded; and then
perhaps he would change his ways and stop calling her Billy and Kid. She was not
a boy, and she was not a kid; but a grown-up woman, just as good as he was and,
it might be, just as smart. And oh, if she could only find that hidden mine and
dig out a mule-load of gold! It would serve him right, when he came back <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>from Los Angeles or from
having a good time inside, to find that his mine had been jumped by a girl and
that she had taken him at his word. He had challenged her to find it, and dared
her to stake it&#8211;very well, she would show him what a desert girl can do,
once she makes up her mind to play the game.</p>

<p>He was always exhorting her to play the game, and to forget all that
righteousness stuff&#8211;as if being righteous was worse than a crime, and a
reflection upon the intelligence as well. But she would let him know that even
the righteous can play the game, and if she could ever stake his mine she would
show him no mercy until he confessed that he had been wrong. And then she would
compel him to make his peace with Eells and&#8211;but that could be settled
later. She rode home in a whirl, now imagining herself triumphant and laying
down the law to him and Eells; then coming back to earth and thinking up excuses
to offer when her lover returned. He might find her tracks, where she had
followed on his trail&#8211;well, she would tell him about Good Luck, and how he
had led her up the trail until at last he had run away and left her. And if he
demanded the kiss&#8211;instead of asking for it nicely&#8211;well, that would
be a good time to quarrel.</p>

<p>It was almost Machiavellian, the way she schemed and plotted, and upon her
return home she burst into tears and informed her mother that Good Luck was
lost. But her early training in the verities now stood <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>her in good stead, for Good Luck was
lost; so of course she was telling the truth, though it was a long way from
being the whole truth. And the tears were real tears, for her conscience began
to trouble her the moment she faced her mother. Yet as beginners at poker often
win through their ignorance, and because nobody can tell when they will bluff,
so Wilhelmina succeeded beyond measure in her first bout at &#8220;playing the
game.&#8221; For if her efforts lacked finesse she had a life-time of
truth-telling to back up the clumsiest deceit. And besides, the Campbells had
troubles of their own without picking at flaws in their daughter. She had come
to an age when she was restive of all restraint and they wisely left her
alone.</p>

<p>The second day of Wunpost&#8217;s absence she went up to her father&#8217;s
mine and brought back the burros, packed with ore; but on the third day she
stayed at home, working feverishly in her new garden and watching for
Wunpost&#8217;s return. His arm was not yet healed and he might injure it by
digging, or his mules might fly back and hurt him; and ever since his departure
she had thought of nothing else but those Apaches who had twice tried to murder
him. What if they had spied him from the heights and followed him to his mine,
or waylaid him and killed him for his money? She had not thought of that when
she had made their foolish bet, but it left her sick with regrets. And if
anything happened to him she could never forgive herself, for she would be the
cause of it all. She watched the ridge till evening, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>then ran up to her lookout&#8211;and
there he was, riding in from the <i>north</i>. Her heart stood still, for who
would look for him there; and then as he waved at her she gathered up her
hindering skirts and ran down the hill to meet him.</p>

<p>He rode in majestically, swaying about on his big mule; and behind him
followed his pack-mule, weighed down with two kyacks of ore, and Good Luck was
tied on the pack. Nothing had happened to him, he was safe&#8211;and yet
something must have happened, for he was riding in from the north.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she panted as he dropped down to greet
her, and before she knew it she had rushed into his arms and given him the kiss
and more. &#8220;I was afraid the Indians had killed you,&#8221; she explained,
and he patted her hands and stood dumb. Something poignant was striving within
him for expression, but he could only pat her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; he said and slipped his arm around her waist, at which
Wilhelmina looked up and smiled. She had intended to quarrel with him, so he
would depart for Los Angeles and leave her free to go steal his mine&#8211;but
that was æons ago, before she knew her own heart or realized how wrong it would
be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You like me; don&#8217;t you, kid?&#8221; he remarked at last, and she
nodded and looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;and then you spoil it all. You
must take your arm away now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his arm away, and then it crept back again in a rapturous, bear-like
hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, quit your fooling, kid,&#8221; he murmured in <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>her ear, &#8220;you know you like me a
lot. And say, I&#8217;m going to ask you a leading question&#8211;will you
promise to answer &#8216;Yes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed and let her go, all but one hand that he held, and then he drew
her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want you to be my
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited, but there was no answer; only a swaying away from him and a
reluctant striving against his grip. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; he urged,
&#8220;let&#8217;s go in to Los Angeles and you can help me spend my money.
I&#8217;ve got lots of it, kid, and it&#8217;s yours for the asking&#8211;the
whole or any part of it. But you&#8217;re too pretty a girl to be shut up here
in Jail Canyon, working your hands off at packing ore and slaving around like
Hungry Bill&#8217;s daughters&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded, striking his hands aside and
turning to face him angrily, and Wunpost saw he had gone too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, now, Wilhelmina,&#8221; he pleaded, then fell into a sulky silence
as she tossed back her curls and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; she burst out, &#8220;that I like to
work for my father? Well, I do; and I ought to do more! And I&#8217;d like to
know where Hungry Bill comes in&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t!&#8221; stated Wunpost, who was beginning to see red;
but she rushed on, undeterred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#x2500;because you don&#8217;t need to think I&#8217;m a
<i>squaw</i>. We may be poor, but you can&#8217;t buy <i>me</i>&#8211;and my
father doesn&#8217;t need to keep <i>watch</i> of me. I guess <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span> I&#8217;ve been brought
up to act like a lady, if I did&#8211;oh, I just hate the sight of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She ended a little weakly, for the memory of that kiss made her blush and
hang her head; but Wunpost had been trained to match hate with a hate, and he
reared up his mane and stepped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, who said you were a squaw?&#8221; he retorted arrogantly.
&#8220;But you might as well be, by grab! Only old Hungry Bill takes his girls
down to town, but you never git to go nowhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go!&#8221; she cried in a passion. &#8220;I want
to stay here and help all I can. But all you talk about now is how much money
you&#8217;ve got, as if nothing else in the world ever counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, forget it!&#8221; grumbled Wunpost, swinging up on his mule and
starting off up the canyon. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go off and give you a rest. And
maybe them girls in Los Angeles won&#8217;t treat me quite so
high-headed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; began Wilhelmina&#8211;but she did, and so
she stopped. And then the old plan, conceived æons ago, rose up and took
possession of her mind. She followed along behind him, and already in her
thoughts she was the owner of the Sockdolager Mine. She held it for herself,
without recognizing his claims or any that Eells might bring; and while she dug
out the gold and shoveled it into sacks they stood by and looked on enviously.
But when her mules were loaded she took the gold away and gave it to her father
for his road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; she repeated, and she meant it.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FINE PRINT</span></h2>

<p>A week passed by, and Wilhelmina rode into Blackwater and mailed a letter to
the County Recorder; and a week later she came back, to receive a letter in
return and to buy at the store with gold. And then the big news broke&#8211;the
Sockdolager had been found&#8211;and there was a stampede that went clear to the
peaks. Blackwater was abandoned, and swarming again the next day with the second
wave of stampeders; and the day after that John C. Calhoun piled out of the
stage and demanded to see Wilhelmina. He hardly knew her at first, for she had
bought a new dress; and she sat in an office up over the bank, talking business
with several important persons.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear?&#8221; he demanded truculently, when he had
cleared the room of all callers. &#8220;I hear you&#8217;ve located my
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;But of course it wasn&#8217;t
yours&#8211;and besides, you said I could have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it at?&#8221; he snapped, sweating and fighting back his
hair, and when she told him he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you find it?&#8221; he asked, and then he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>groaned again, for she
had followed his own fresh trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stung!&#8221; he moaned and sank down in a chair, at which she dimpled
prettily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but it was all for your own good. And
anyway, you dared me to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; he assented with a weary sigh. &#8220;Well, what do
you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to sell out
to Mr. Eells and&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Eells!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Well, by the holy, jumping
Judas&#8211;how much is he going to give you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty thousand dollars and&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Forty thousand!</i>Say, she&#8217;s worth forty <i>million</i>! For
cripes&#8217; sake&#8211;have you signed the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t, but&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, <i>don&#8217;t</i>! Don&#8217;t you do
it&#8211;don&#8217;t you dare to sign anything, not even a receipt for your
money! Oh, my Lord, I just got here in time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; ended Wilhelmina, and then for the
first time he noticed the look in her eye. It was as cold and steely as a
gun-fighter&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he clamored. &#8220;You
ain&#8217;t sore at me, are you? But even if you are, don&#8217;t sign any
papers until I tell you about that mine. How much ore have you got in
sight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, just that one vein, where it goes under the black
rock&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s two others!&#8221; he panted, &#8220;that I covered up on
purpose. Oh, my Lord, this is simply awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two others!&#8221; echoed Wilhelmina, and then she <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>sat dumb while a scared
look crept into her eyes. &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; she went
on at last, &#8220;and of course we lost everything, that other time. So when
Mr. Eells offered me forty thousand cash and agreed to release you from that
grubstake contract&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You throwed the whole thing away, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had turned sullen now and petulantly discontented and the fire flashed
back into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is that all the thanks I get? I thought you <i>wanted</i> that
contract!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; he complained, &#8220;but if you&#8217;d left me alone
I&#8217;d&#8217;ve got it away from him for nothing. But forty thousand dollars!
Say, what&#8217;s your doggoned hurry&#8211;have you got to sell out the first
day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but that time before, when he tried to buy us out I held on until
I didn&#8217;t get anything. And father has been waiting for his road so
long&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that road again!&#8221; snarled Wunpost. &#8220;Is that all you
think about? You&#8217;ve thrown away millions of dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, I&#8217;ve got the road!&#8221; she answered with
spirit, &#8220;and that&#8217;s more than I did before. If I&#8217;d followed my
own judgment instead of taking your advice&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your judgment!&#8221; he mocked; &#8220;say, shake yourself,
kid&#8211;you&#8217;ve pulled the biggest bonehead of a life-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get forty
thousand dollars. And if Father builds his road our <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>mine will be worth millions, so why
shouldn&#8217;t I let this one go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, boys!&#8221; sighed Wunpost and slumped down in his chair, then
roused up with a wild look in his eyes. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t signed up, have
you?&#8221; he demanded again. &#8220;Well, thank God, then, I got here in
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because I told him
I&#8217;d do it and we&#8217;ve already drawn up the papers. At first he
wouldn&#8217;t hear to it, to release you from your contract; but when I told
him I wouldn&#8217;t sell without it, he and Lapham had a conference and
they&#8217;re downstairs now having it copied. There are to be three copies, one
for each of us and one for you, because of course you&#8217;re an interested
party. And I thought, if you were released, you could go out and find another
mine and&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another one!&#8221; raved Wunpost. &#8220;Say, you must think
it&#8217;s easy! I&#8217;ll never find another one in a life-time. Another
Sockdolager? I could sell that mine tomorrow for a million dollars, cash;
it&#8217;s got a hundred thousand dollars in sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you told me when we had the Willie Meena, and
now already they say it&#8217;s worked out&#8211;and I know Mr. Eells
isn&#8217;t rich. He had to send to Los Angeles to get the money for this first
payment&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, have you accepted his <i>money</i>?&#8221; shouted Wunpost
accusingly, and Wilhelmina rose to her feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>&#8220;Mr.
Calhoun,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you to understand that I own
this mine myself. And I&#8217;m not going to sit here and be yelled at like a
Mexican&#8211;not by you or anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s yours, is it?&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;Well, excuse me
for living; but who came across it in the first place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you did,&#8221; she conceded, &#8220;and if you hadn&#8217;t
been always bragging about it you might be owning it yet. But you were always
showing off, and making fun of my father, and saying we were all such
<i>fools</i>&#8211;so I thought I&#8217;d just <i>show</i> you, and it&#8217;s no
use talking now, because I&#8217;ve agreed to sell it to Eells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, kid,&#8221; he nodded, after a long minute of
silence. &#8220;I reckon I had it coming to me. But, by grab, I never thought
that little Billy Campbell would throw the hooks into me like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;only you just
treated us like dirt. I&#8217;m glad, and I&#8217;d do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve learned one thing,&#8221; he muttered gloomily;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll never trust a woman again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now isn&#8217;t that just like a man!&#8221; exclaimed Wilhelmina
indignantly. &#8220;You know you never trusted anybody. I asked you one time
where you got all that ore and you looked smart and said: &#8216;That&#8217;s a
question. If I&#8217;d tell you, you&#8217;d know the answer.&#8217; Those were
the very words you said. And now you&#8217;ll never trust a woman
again!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>She laughed, and
Wunpost rose slowly to his feet, but he did not get out of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she taunted; &#8220;did &#8216;them Los
Angeles girls&#8217; fool you, too? Or am I the only one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one,&#8221; he answered ambiguously, and stood
looking at her queerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, cheer up!&#8221; she dimpled, for her mood was gay.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find another one, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No I won&#8217;t,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;re the only one,
Billy. But I never looked for nothing like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you told me to get onto myself and learn to play the game, and
finally I took you at your word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say a word. But these
Blackwater stiffs will sure throw it into me when they find I&#8217;ve been
trimmed by a girl. The best thing I can do is to drift.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand on the door-knob, but she knew he would not go, and he turned
back with a sheepish grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do the folks think about this?&#8221; he inquired casually, and
Wilhelmina made a face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They think I&#8217;m just <i>awful</i>!&#8221; she confessed.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t care&#8211;I&#8217;m tired of being poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reckon there&#8217;ll be another cloudburst, do you, about
the time you get your road built?&#8221;</p>

<p>She grew sober at that and then her eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;and besides, I
didn&#8217;t steal this. You told me I could have it, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>&#8220;Too fine
a point for me,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just see, after you build
your new road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to build it,&#8221; she stated, &#8220;because
he&#8217;ll worry himself to death. And I don&#8217;t care what happens to me,
as long as he gets his road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em that wanted all kinds of things, but
you&#8217;re the first one that wanted a road. And so you&#8217;re going to sign
this contract if it loses you a million dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve drawn it all up and
I&#8217;ve given him my word, so there&#8217;s nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Tell him you&#8217;ve changed
your mind and want a million dollars. Tell him that I&#8217;ve come back and
don&#8217;t want that grubstake contract and that you&#8217;ll take it all in
cash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she frowned, &#8220;now there&#8217;s no use arguing,
because I&#8217;ve fully made up my mind. And if&#x2500;&#8221; She paused and
listened as steps came down the hall. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming,&#8221; she
said and smiled.</p>

<p>There was a rapid patter of feet and Lapham rapped and came in, bearing some
papers and his notary&#8217;s stamp; but when he saw Wunpost he stopped and
stood aghast, while his stamp fell to the floor with a bang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why&#8211;oh, excuse me!&#8221; he broke out, turning to dart
through the door; but the mighty bulk of Eells had blocked his way and now it
forced him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;what&#8217;s this?&#8221; demanded Eells, and then he saw
Wunpost and his lip dropped down and came <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_249'></a>249</span>up. &#8220;Oh, excuse me, Miss Campbell,&#8221; he
burst out hastily, &#8220;we&#8217;ll come back&#8211;didn&#8217;t know you were
occupied.&#8221; He started to back out and Wunpost and Wilhelmina exchanged
glances, for they had never seen him flustered before. But now he was stampeded,
though why they could not guess, for he had never feared Wunpost before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t go!&#8221; cried Wilhelmina; &#8220;we were just
waiting for you to come. <i>Please</i> come back&#8211;I want to have it over
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flew to the door and held it open and Eells and his lawyer filed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me disturb you,&#8221; said Wunpost grimly and stood
with his back to the wall. There was something in the wind, he could guess that
already, and he waited to see what would happen. But if Eells had been startled
his nerve had returned, and he proceeded with ponderous dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t take but a moment,&#8221; he observed to Wilhelmina
as he spread the papers before her. &#8220;Here are the three copies of our
agreement and&#8221;&#8211;he shook out his fountain pen&#8211;&#8220;you put
your name right there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you don&#8217;t!&#8221; spoke up Wunpost, breaking in on the spell,
&#8220;don&#8217;t sign nothing that you haven&#8217;t read.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fixed her with his eyes and as Wilhelmina read his thoughts she laid down
the waiting pen. Eells drew up his lip, Lapham shuffled uneasily, and Wilhelmina
took up the contract. She glanced through it page by page, dipping in here and
there and then <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_250'></a>250</span>turning impatiently ahead; and as she struggled with
its verbiage the sweat burst from Eells&#8217; face and ran unnoticed down his
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she smiled, and was picking up the pen when she
paused and turned hurriedly back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything the matter?&#8221; croaked Lapham, clearing his throat and
hovering over her, and Wilhelmina looked up helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; please show me the place where it tells about that
contract&#8211;the one for Mr. Calhoun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;yes,&#8221; stammered Lapham, and then he hesitated and
glanced across at Eells. &#8220;Why&#8211;er&#x2500;&#8221; he began, running
rapidly through the sheets, and John C. Calhoun strode forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; he said, nodding significantly at
Wilhelmina and grabbing up the damning papers. &#8220;That&#8217;ll do for
you,&#8221; he said to Lapham. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have you in the Pen for
this.&#8221; And when Lapham and Eells both rushed at him at once he struck them
aside with one hand. For they did not come on fighting, but all in a tremble,
clutching wildly to get back the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; announced Wunpost; &#8220;that clause isn&#8217;t
there. This is one time when we read the fine print.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A COME-BACK</span></h2>

<p>It takes an iron nerve to come back for more punishment right after a solar
plexus blow, but Judson Eells had that kind. Phillip F. Lapham went to pieces
and began to beg, but Eells reached out for the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just give me that contract,&#8221; he suggested amiably; &#8220;there
must be some mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you bet there&#8217;s a mistake,&#8221; came back Wunpost
triumphantly, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll show these papers to the judge. This
ain&#8217;t the first time you&#8217;ve tried to put one over, but you robbed us
once before.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Wilhelmina, whose eyes were dark with rage, and she nodded and
stood close beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I was selling it for almost nothing,
just to get that miserable grubstake. Oh, I think you just ought to
be&#8211;hung!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took one of the contracts and ran through it to make sure, and Eells
coughed and sent Lapham away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s sit down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and talk this matter
over. And if, through an oversight, the clause <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_252'></a>252</span>has been left out perhaps we can make other
arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; declared Wunpost. &#8220;You&#8217;re a crook
and you know it; and I don&#8217;t want that grubstake contract, nohow. And
there&#8217;s a feller in town that I know for a certainty will give five
hundred thousand dollars, cash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; protested Eells, but his glance was uneasy and he
smiled when Wilhelmina spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>do</i>!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want that grubstake
contract cancelled. But forty thousand dollars&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you more,&#8221; put in Eells, suddenly coming to
life. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bond your mine for a hundred thousand dollars if
you&#8217;ll give me a little more time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you bring out that grubstake contract and have it cancelled
in my presence?&#8221; demanded Wilhelmina peremptorily, and Eells bowed before
the storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;although a hundred
thousand dollars&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a hundred thousand in sight!&#8221; broke in Wunpost
intolerantly. &#8220;But what do you want to trade with a crook like that
for?&#8221; he demanded of Wilhelmina, &#8220;when I can get you a certified
check? Is he the only man in town that can buy your mine? I&#8217;ll bet you I
can find you twenty. And if you don&#8217;t get an offer of five hundred
thousand cash&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it two hundred,&#8221; interposed Judson Eells
hastily, &#8220;and surrender the cancelled grubstake!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t <i>want</i> the danged grubstake!&#8221; burst out Wunpost
impatiently. &#8220;What good is it now, when my claim has been jumped and I
ain&#8217;t got a prospect in sight? No, it ain&#8217;t worth a cent, now that
the Sockdolager is located, and I don&#8217;t want it counted for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> want it,&#8221; objected Wilhelmina, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
willing to let it count. But if others will pay me more&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bond your mine,&#8221; began Judson Eells desperately,
&#8220;for four hundred thousand dollars&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it,&#8221; came back Wunpost, &#8220;because under
a bond and lease he can take possession of your property. And if he ever gits
a-hold of it&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking to Miss Campbell,&#8221; blustered Eells
indignantly, but his guns were spiked again. Wilhelmina knew his record too
well, for he had driven her from the Willie Meena, and yet she lingered on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I should sell my mine
elsewhere; how much would you take for that grubstake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t sell it at any price!&#8221; returned Judson Eells
instantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that he has other claims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, how much will you give me in cash for my mine and throw
the grubstake in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you four hundred thousand dollars in four yearly
payments&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it,&#8221; butted in Wunpost, but Wilhelmina <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>turned upon him and he
read the decision in her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But this time the papers
will be drawn up by a lawyer that I will hire. And I must say, Mr. Eells, I
think the way you changed those papers&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to put him in the Pen,&#8221; observed Wunpost vindictively.
&#8220;You&#8217;re easy&#8211;and you&#8217;re compounding a felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what that is,&#8221; answered Wilhelmina
recklessly, &#8220;but anyway, I&#8217;ll get that grubstake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know one thing,&#8221; stated Wunpost. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to keep these papers until he makes the last of those payments. Because if he
don&#8217;t dig that gold out inside of four years it won&#8217;t be because he
don&#8217;t <i>try</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you give them to me,&#8221; she demanded, pouting, and Wunpost
handed them over. This was a new one on him&#8211;Wilhelmina turning pouty! But
the big fight was over, and when Eells went away she dismissed John C. Calhoun
and cried.</p>

<p>It takes time to draw up an ironclad contract that will hold a man as
slippery as Eells, but two outside lawyers who had come in with the rush did
their best to make it air-tight. And even after that Wunpost took it to Los
Angeles to show a lawyer who was his <i>friend</i>. When it came back from the
friend there was a proviso against everything, including death and acts of God.
But Judson Eells signed it and made a first payment of twenty-five thousand
dollars <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>down, after
which John C. Calhoun suddenly dropped out of sight before Wilhelmina could
thank him. She heard of him later as being in Los Angeles, and then he came back
through Blackwater; but before she could see him he was gone again, on some
mysterious errand into the hills. Then she returned to the ranch and missed him
again, for he went by without making a stop. A month had gone by before she met
him on the street, and then she <i>knew</i> he was avoiding her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good morning, Miss Campbell,&#8221; he exclaimed, bowing
gallantly; &#8220;how&#8217;s the mine and every little thing? You&#8217;re
looking fine, there&#8217;s nothing to it; but say, I&#8217;ve got to be
going!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started to rush on, but Wilhelmina stopped him and looked him
reproachfully in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been all the time?&#8221; she chided. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got something I want to give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, keep it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll drop in and get
it. See you later.&#8221; And he started to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, wait!&#8221; she implored, tagging resolutely after him, and
Wunpost halted reluctantly. &#8220;Now I <i>know</i> you&#8217;re mad at
me,&#8221; she charged; &#8220;that&#8217;s the first time you ever called me
Miss Campbell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Well, it must have been the
clothes. When you wore overalls you was Billy, and that white dress made it
Wilhelmina; and now it&#8217;s Miss Campbell, and then some.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and mopped the sweat from his perspiring brow, but he refused to
meet her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come up to my office?&#8221; she asked <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>very meekly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something important to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that feller Eells trying to beat you out of your money?&#8221; he
demanded with sudden heat, but she declined to discuss business on the street.
In her office she sat him down and closed the door behind them, then drew out a
contract from her desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s that grubstake agreement, all cancelled,&#8221; she said,
and he took it and grunted ungraciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he rumbled; &#8220;now what&#8217;s the important
business? Is the bank going broke, or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; she answered, beginning to blink back the tears,
&#8220;what makes you talk like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was just into Los Angeles, trying to round up that bank
examiner, and I thought maybe he&#8217;d made his report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;really?&#8221; she cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think the
bank is safe? Why, all my money is there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much you got?&#8221; he asked, and when she told him he snorted.
&#8220;Twenty-five thousand, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;How&#8217;d he pay
you&#8211;with a check? Well, he might not have had a cent. A man that will rob
a girl will rob his depositors&#8211;you&#8217;d better draw out a few
hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose up in alarm, but something in his smile made her sit down and eye
him accusingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; she said at last;
&#8220;you&#8217;re trying to break his bank. You always said you
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that stuff!&#8221; he jeered, &#8220;that was nothing but <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>hot air. I&#8217;m a
blow-hard&#8211;everybody knows that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him again, and her face became very grave, for she knew what
was gnawing at his heart. And she was far from being convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t thank me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for returning your
grubstake. Does that mean you really don&#8217;t care? Or are you just mad
because I took away your mine? Of course I know you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m mad,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you be
mad? Well, why should I thank you for this? You take away my mine, that was
worth millions of dollars, and gimme back a piece of paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slapped the contract against his leg and thrust it roughly into his shirt,
at which Wilhelmina burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m sorry I stole it,&#8221; she confessed between sobs,
&#8220;and now Father and everybody is against me. But I did it for you&#8211;so
you wouldn&#8217;t get killed&#8211;and so Father could have his road. And now
he won&#8217;t take it, because the money isn&#8217;t ours. He says I&#8217;m to
return it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you tell your old man,&#8221; burst out Wunpost brutally,
&#8220;that he&#8217;s crazy and I won&#8217;t touch a cent. I guess I know how
to get my rights without any help from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221; she queried tremulously, but he shut his
mouth down grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you just hold your breath, and
listen for something to drop. I ain&#8217;t through, by no manner of
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to fight Eells!&#8221; she cried out <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>reproachfully. &#8220;I
just know something dreadful will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet your life it will&#8211;but not to me. I&#8217;m after that
old boy&#8217;s hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t you take the money?&#8221; she asked regretfully, and
when he shook his head she wept. It was not easy weeping, for Wilhelmina was not
the kind that practises before a mirror, and the agony of it touched his
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, say, kid,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;don&#8217;t take on like
that&#8211;the world hasn&#8217;t come to an end. You ain&#8217;t cut out for
this rough stuff, even if you did steal me blind, but I&#8217;m not so sore as
all that. You tell your old man that I&#8217;ll accept ten thousand dollars if
he&#8217;ll let me rebuild that road&#8211;because ever since it washed out
I&#8217;ve felt conscience-stricken as hell over starting that cloudburst down
his canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose up gaily, but she refused to be comforted until he laid his big hand
on her head, and then she sprang up and threw both arms around his neck and made
him give her a kiss. But she did not ask him to forgive her.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WUNPOST HAS A BAD DREAM</span></h2>

<p>It is dangerous to start rumors against even the soundest of banks, because
our present-day finance is no more than a house of cards built precariously on
Public Confidence. No bank can pay interest, or even do business, if it keeps
all its money in the vaults; and yet in times of panic, if a run ever starts,
every depositor comes clamoring for his money. Public confidence is
shaken&#8211;and the house of cards falls, carrying with it the fortunes of all.
The depositors lose their money, the bankers lose their money; and thousands of
other people in nowise connected with it are ruined by the failure of one bank.
Hence the committee of Blackwater citizens, with blood in their eye, which
called on John C. Calhoun.</p>

<p>Since the loss of his mine Wunpost had turned ugly and morose; and his
remarks about Eells, and especially about his bank, were nicely calculated to
get under the rind. He was waiting for the committee, right in front of the
bank; and the moment they began to talk he began to orate, and to denounce them
and everything else in Blackwater. What was intended as a call-down of an
envious and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_260'></a>260</span>destructive agitator threatened momentarily to turn
into a riot and, hearing his own good name brought into question, Judson Eells
stepped quickly out and challenged his bold traducer.</p>

<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, sure I said it!&#8221; answered Wunpost hotly, &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t mind saying it again. Your bank is all a fake, like your danged tin
front; and you&#8217;ve got everything in your vault except money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, Mr. Calhoun,&#8221; returned Judson Eells waspishly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to challenge that statement, right now. What authority
have you got for suggesting that my cash is less than the law
requires?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Wunpost, &#8220;of course I don&#8217;t
<i>know</i>, but&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course you don&#8217;t know!&#8221; replied Eells with a smile,
&#8220;and everybody knows you don&#8217;t know; but your remarks are actionable
and if you don&#8217;t shut up and go away I&#8217;ll instruct my attorney to
sue you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8216;shut up,&#8217; eh?&#8221; repeated Wunpost after the crowd had
had its laugh; &#8220;you think I&#8217;m a blow-hard, eh? You all do,
don&#8217;t you? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do.&#8221; He paused
impressively, reached down into several pockets and pointed a finger at Eells.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve got more money
in my clothes than you have in your whole danged bank&#8211;and if you can prove
any different I&#8217;ll acknowledge I&#8217;m wrong by depositing my roll in
your bank. Now&#8211;that&#8217;s fair enough, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded and leered knowingly at the gaping crowd as Eells began to
temporize and hedge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m
a blow-hard, am I?&#8221; he shouted uproariously; &#8220;my remarks are
actionable, are they? Well, if I should go into court and tell half of what I
know there&#8217;d be <i>two</i> men on their way to the Pen!&#8221; He pointed
two fingers at Eells and Phillip Lapham and the banker saw a change in the
crowd. Public confidence was wavering, the cold fingers of doubt were clutching
at the hearts of his depositors&#8211;but behind it all he sensed a trap. It was
not by accident that Wunpost was on his corner when the committee of citizens
came by; and this bet of his was no accident either, but part of some carefully
laid scheme. The question was&#8211;how much money did Wunpost have? If, unknown
to them, he had found access to large sums and had come there with the money on
his person, then the acceptance of his bet would simply result in a farce and
make the bank a byword and a mocking. If it could be said on the street that one
disreputable prospector had more money in his clothes than the bank, then public
confidence would receive a shrewd blow indeed, which might lead to disastrous
results. But the murmur of doubt was growing, Wunpost was ranting like a
demagogue&#8211;the time for a show-down had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; shouted Eells, and as the crowd began to cheer the
committee adjourned to the bank. Eells strode in behind the counter and threw
the vault doors open, his cashier and Lapham made the count, and when Wunpost
was permitted to see the cash himself his face fell and he fumbled in his
pockets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>&#8220;You
win,&#8221; he announced, and while all Blackwater whooped and capered he
deposited his roll in the bank. It was a fabulously big roll&#8211;over forty
thousand dollars in five hundred and thousand dollar bills&#8211;but he
deposited it all without saying a word and went out to buy the drinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the drinks are on me.
But I wanted to know that that money was <i>safe</i> before I went in and put it
in the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a great triumph for Eells and a great boost for his bank, and he
insisted in the end upon shaking hands with Wunpost and assuring him there was
no hard feeling. Wunpost took it all grimly, for he claimed to be a sport, but
he saddled up soon after and departed for the hills, leaving Blackwater
delirious with joy. So old Wunpost had been stung and called again by the
redoubtable Judson Eells, and the bank had been proved to be perfectly sound and
a credit to the community it served! It made pretty good reading for the
<i>Blackwater Blade</i>, which had recently been established in their midst, and
the committee of boosters ordered a thousand extra copies and sent them all over
the country. That was real mining stuff, and every dollar of Wunpost&#8217;s
money had been dug from the Sockdolager Mine. Eells set to work immediately to
build him a road and to order the supplies and machinery, and as the development
work was pushed towards completion John C. Calhoun was almost forgotten. He was
gone, that was all they knew, and if he never came back it would be soon enough
for Eells.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>But there was
one who still watched for the prodigal&#8217;s return and longed ardently for
his coming, for Wilhelmina Campbell still remembered with regret the days when
their ranch had been his goal. No matter where he had been, or what desperate
errand took him once more into the hills, he had headed for their ranch like a
homing pigeon that longs to join its mates. The portal of her tunnel had been
their trysting place, where he had boasted and raged and denounced all his
enemies and promised to return with their scalps. But that was just his way, and
it was harmless after all, and wonderfully exciting and amusing; but now the
ranch was dead, except for the gang of road-makers who came by from their camp
up the canyon.</p>

<p>For her father at last had consented to build the road, since Wunpost had
disclaimed all title to the mine; but now it was his daughter who looked on with
a heavy heart, convinced that the money was accursed. She had stolen it, she
knew, from the man who had been her lover and who had trusted her as no one
else; only Wunpost was too proud to make any protest or even acknowledge he had
been wronged. He had accepted his loss with the grim stoicism of a gambler and
gone out again into the hills, and the only thought that rose up to comfort her
was that he had deposited all his money in the bank. Every dollar, so they said;
and when he had bought his supplies the store-keeper had had to write out his
check! But anyway he was safe, for now everybody knew that he had no money on
his person; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>and
when he came back he might stop at the ranch and she could tell him about the
road.</p>

<p>It was being built by contract, and more solidly than ever, and already it
was through the gorge and well up the canyon towards Panamint and the Homestake
Mine. And the mud and rocks that the cloudburst had deposited had been dug out
and cleared away from their trees; the ditch had been enlarged, her garden
restored and everything left tidy and clean. But something was lacking and, try
as she would, she failed to feel the least thrill of joy. Their poverty had been
hard, and the waiting and disappointments; but even if the Homestake Mine turned
out to be a world-beater she would always feel that somehow it was <i>his</i>.
But when Wunpost came back he did not stop at the ranch&#8211;she saw him
passing by on the trail.</p>

<p>He rode in hot haste, heading grimly for Blackwater, and when he spurred down
the main street the crowd set up a yell, for they had learned to watch for him
now. When Wunpost came to town there was sure to be something doing, something
big that called for the drinks; and all the pocket-miners and saloon bums were
there, lined up to see him come in. But whether he had made a strike in his
lucky way or was back for another bout with Eells was more than any man could
say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; hailed a friend, or pseudo-friend, stepping out
to make him stop at the saloon, &#8220;hold on, what&#8217;s biting you
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stop,&#8221; announced Wunpost, spurring on <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>towards the bank,
&#8220;by grab, I&#8217;ve had a bad dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dream, eh?&#8221; echoed the friend, and then the crowd laughed and
followed on up to the bank. Since Wunpost had lost in his bet with Eells and
deposited all his money in the bank he was looked upon almost with pride as a
picturesque asset of the town. He made talk, and that was made into publicity,
and publicity helped the town. And now this mad prank upon which he seemed bent
gave promise of even greater renown. So he had had a bad dream? That piqued
their curiosity, but they were not kept long in doubt. Dismounting at the bank,
he glanced up at the front and then made a plunge through the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme my money!&#8221; he demanded, bringing his fist down with a bang
and making a grab for a check. &#8220;Gimme all of it&#8211;every danged
cent!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started to write and threw the pen to the floor as it sputtered and ruined
his handiwork.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Calhoun?&#8221; cried Eells in
astonishment, as the crowd came piling in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme a pen!&#8221; commanded Wunpost, and, having seized the
cashier&#8217;s, he began laboriously to write. &#8220;There!&#8221; he said,
shoving the check through the wicket; and then he stood waiting, expectant.</p>

<p>The cashier glanced at the check and passed it back to Eells, who had
hastened behind the grille, and then they looked at each other in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;er&#8211;this check,&#8221; began Eells, &#8220;calls for
forty-two thousand, eight hundred and fifty-two dollars. Do you want all that
money now?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>&#8220;W&#8217;y,
sure!&#8221; shrilled Wunpost, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I tell you I wanted
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s rather unusual,&#8221; went on Judson Eells lamely,
and then he spoke in an aside to his cashier.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! None of that, now!&#8221; burst out Wunpost in a fury,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you frame up any monkey-business on me! I want my money, see?
And I want it right now! Dig up, or I&#8217;ll wreck the whole dump!&#8221;</p>

<p>He brought his hand down again and Judson Eells retired while the cashier
began to count out the bills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; objected Wunpost, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want all that
small stuff&#8211;where&#8217;s those thousand dollar bills I turned in?
They&#8217;re <i>gone</i>? Well, for cripes&#8217; sake, did you think they were
a <i>present</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk started to explain, but Wunpost would not listen to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bunch of crooks!&#8221; he burst out indignantly.
&#8220;I only deposited that money on a bet! And here you turn loose and spend
the whole roll, and start to pay me back in fives and tens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but Mr. Calhoun,&#8221; broke in Judson Eells impatiently,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t understand how banking is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I do!&#8221; yelled back Wunpost, &#8220;but, by grab, I had a
dream, and I dreamt that your danged bank was <i>broke</i>! Now gimme my money,
and give it to me quick or I&#8217;ll come in there and git it
myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited, grim and watchful, and they counted out the bills while he nodded
and stuffed them into his shirt. And then they brought out gold in
government-stamped sacks and he dropped them between <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>his feet. But the gold was not enough,
and while Eells stood pale and silent the clerk dragged out the silver from the
vault. Wunpost took them one by one, the great thousand dollar sacks, and added
them to the pile at his feet, and still his demand was unsatisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Eells, &#8220;but that&#8217;s all
we have. And I consider this very unfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfair!&#8221; yelled Wunpost. &#8220;W&#8217;y, you doggone thief,
you&#8217;ve robbed me of two thousand dollars. But that&#8217;s all
right,&#8221; he added; &#8220;it shows my dream was true. And now your tin bank
<i>is</i> broke!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the crowd, which looked on in stunned silence, and tucked in his
money-stuffed shirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m a blow-hard, am I?&#8221; he inquired sarcastically, and
no one said a word.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN TRUST</span></h2>

<p>There was cursing and wailing and gnashing of teeth in Blackwater&#8217;s
saloons that night, and some were for hanging Wunpost; but in the morning, when
they woke up and found Eells and Lapham gone, they transferred their rage to
them. A committee composed of the dummy directors, who had allowed Eells to do
what he would, discovered from the books that the bank had been looted and that
Eells was a fugitive from justice. He had diverted the bank&#8217;s funds to his
own private uses, leaving only his unsecured notes; and Lapham, the shrewd fox,
had levied blackmail on his chief by charging huge sums for legal service. And
now they were both gone and the Blackwater depositors had been left without a
cent.</p>

<p>It was galling to their pride to see Wunpost stalking about and exhibiting
his dream-restored wealth; but no one could say that he had not warned them, and
he was loser by two thousand dollars himself. But even at that they considered
it poor taste when he hung a piece of crepe on the door. As for the God-given
dream which he professed to have received, there were those who questioned its
authenticity; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>but
whatever his hunch was, it had saved him forty-odd thousand dollars, which he
had deposited with Wells Fargo and Company. They had never gone broke yet, as
far as he knew, and they had started as a Pony Express.</p>

<p>But there was one painful feature about his bank-wrecking triumph which
Wunpost had failed to anticipate, and as poor people who had lost their all came
and stood before the bank he hung his head and moved on. It was all right for
Old Whiskers and men of his stripe, whose profession was predatory itself; but
when the hard-rock miners and road-makers came in the heady wine of triumph lost
its bead. There are no palms of victory without the dust of vain regrets to mar
their gleaming leaves, and when he saw Wilhelmina riding in from Jail Canyon he
retreated to a doorway and winced. This was to have been his high spot, his
magnum of victory; but somehow he sensed that no great joy would come from it,
although of course she had it coming to her. And Wilhelmina simply stared at the
sign &#8220;Bank Closed&#8221; and leaned against the door and cried.</p>

<p>That was too much for Wunpost, who had been handing out five dollars to all
of the workingmen who were broke, and he strode across the street and approached
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>you</i> crying about?&#8221; he asked, and when she shook her
head he shuffled his feet and stood silent. &#8220;Come on up to the
office,&#8221; he said at last, and she followed him to the bare little room.
There <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span> a short time
before he had interceded to save her when she had all but signed the contract
with Eells; but now at one blow he had destroyed what was built up and left her
without a cent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you crying about?&#8221; he repeated, as she sank down by the
desk and fixed him with her sad, reproachful eyes, &#8220;you ought to be
tickled to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve lost all my money,&#8221; she answered dejectedly,
&#8220;and we owe the contractors for the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you
some more money. But say, didn&#8217;t you do what I said? Why, I told you the
last thing before I went away to git that first payment money
<i>out</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not!&#8221; she denied, &#8220;you told me to draw a few
hundred. And then you turned around and deposited all you had, so I thought the
bank must be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;safe with Judson Eells? Safe with Lapham behind the scenes?
Say, you&#8217;ll never do at all. Have you heard the big news? Well,
they&#8217;ve both skipped to Mexico and the depositors won&#8217;t get a
cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what about my contract?&#8221; she burst out tearfully,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve sold him my mine and now he&#8217;s run away, so who&#8217;s
going to make the next payment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t nobody,&#8221; grinned Wunpost, &#8220;and
that&#8217;s just the point&#8211;I told you I&#8217;d come back with his
scalp!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what about <i>us</i>?&#8221; she clamored accusingly,
&#8220;who&#8217;s going to pay for the road and all? Oh, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>I knew all the time that you&#8217;d
never forgive me, and now you&#8217;ve just ruined everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never asked me to forgive you,&#8221; defended Wunpost stoutly,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t mind admitting I was sore. It&#8217;s all right, of
course, if you think you can play the game&#8211;but I never thought you&#8217;d
rob a <i>friend</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you dared me to!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and didn&#8217;t I offer
it for almost nothing, just to keep you from getting killed? And then, after
I&#8217;d done everything to get back your contract you didn&#8217;t even say
&#8216;Thanks!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sure not,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;what should I be thanking
<i>you</i> for? Did I ask you to get back my grubstake? Not by a long shot I
didn&#8217;t&#8211;what I wanted was my mine, and you turned around and sold it
to Eells. Well, where&#8217;s your friend now, and his yeller dog, Lapham?
Skally-hooting across the desert for Mexico!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t my contract any good? Won&#8217;t the bank take it, or
anybody? Oh, I think you&#8217;re just&#8211;just hateful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I am, kid!&#8221; he announced with a swagger,
&#8220;that&#8217;s my long suit, savvy&#8211;hate! I never forgive an enemy and
I never forget a friend, and the man don&#8217;t live that can <i>do</i> me!
I&#8217;ll git him, if it takes a thousand years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you go,&#8221; she sighed, dusting her desk off petulantly,
and then she bowed her head in thought. &#8220;But I must say,&#8221; she
admitted, &#8220;you have done what you said. But I thought you were just
bragging at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>&#8220;They
<i>all</i> did!&#8221; he beamed, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve showed &#8217;em, by
grab&#8211;they ain&#8217;t calling me a blow-hard now. These Blackwater stiffs
that wanted to run me out of town are coming around now to borrow five. They
took up with a crook, just because he boosted for their town, and now
they&#8217;re left holding the sack. But if they&#8217;d listened to me they
wouldn&#8217;t be left flat, because I told &#8217;em I was after his hide. And
say, you should&#8217;ve seen him, when I came into his bank and shoved that big
check under his nose! He knowed what I was thinking and he never said:
&#8216;Boo!&#8217; I showed him whether I knew how to write!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid back and grinned broadly and Wilhelmina smiled, though a wistful look
had crept into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suppose,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re always going to
hate <i>me</i>, because of course I did steal your mine. But now I&#8217;m glad
it&#8217;s gone, because I wasn&#8217;t happy a minute&#8211;do you think you
can forgive me, sometime?&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up appealingly but his brows had come down and he was staring at
her fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; he roared, &#8220;your mine ain&#8217;t gone! Ain&#8217;t
you ever read that contract we framed up? Well, the mine reverts to you the
first time a payment isn&#8217;t made or <i>if the buyer becomes a fugitive from
justice</i>! Yeh, my friend slipped that in along with the rest of it, about
death or an Act of God. Say, that&#8217;s what you might call head
work!&#8221;</p>

<p>He jerked his chin and grinned admiringly but Wilhelmina did not respond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she objected, &#8220;but how do I get the money <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>to pay the men for
building the road? Because the twenty-five thousand dollars that I had in the
bank&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it?&#8221; cried Wunpost, &#8220;why you go up to your mine and
dig out some big chunks of gold, and then you send it out and sell it at the
mint and start a little bank of your own. But say, kid, you&#8217;re all
right&#8211;I like you and all that&#8211;but something tells me you ain&#8217;t
cut out for business. Now you&#8217;d better just turn this mine over to
me&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>will</i> you take it back?&#8221; she cried out impulsively,
leaping up and beginning to smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just <i>wanted</i> to give
it to you but&#8211;well, of course I did steal it. And will you take me back
for a friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I might,&#8221; conceded Wunpost, rising slowly to his feet, and
then he shook his head. &#8220;But you&#8217;re no business woman,&#8221; he
stated, &#8220;what I was trying to say was&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s own it together!&#8221; she dimpled impatiently, and
Wunpost accepted the trust.</p>
